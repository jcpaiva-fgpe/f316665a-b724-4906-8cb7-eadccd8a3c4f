      Chic Barber Shop is not big but it is very clean. Three chairs, where the
      customers wait for their turn before going to the barber's chair, and
      little more there. The barber does not like having clients standing
      get in the way. So when there are no vacancies, customers do not enter!
      But, they can enter if they arrive at the moment when another one is ready, since
      that Chic is open. Chic opens at 9:00 am and closes at 12:00 pm
      lunch. Reopens at 15:00 and closes at 19:00. Customers arriving at
      at 12:00 or until 19:00, inclusive, are served, if Chic is not
      full. Service is on a first-come, first-served basis. Customers do not
      wait if the barber is free and do not wait at the door when the
      Chic is closed or full. There are no hands to measure to not lose customers
      nor make them wait too long. It is intended to simulate the functioning of Chic
      on a certain day, assuming that at most one customer will arrive at most
      and that the barber does not spend more than forty minutes with each client
      (which always gives you some time for lunch).

    </h2> Write a program to determine the number of customers who are not
    were able to enter, and that it will write <code> Lost = r </code>, followed by change
    line, where <code> r </code> is that number. The program will analyze a
    ordered sequence of <code> K </code> occurrences <code> H M D </code>, where
    <code> H </code> and <code> M </code> define the instant the customer arrived
    (<code> H </code> hours and <code> M </code> minutes) and <code> D </code> the time
    (in minutes) that the barber would spend attending the client if he can
    to do. Thus, <code> 9 2 10 </code> indicates that the customer arrived at 9:02 and the
    barber would spend 10 minutes if he answered. The value of <code> K </code> is
    given on the first line.
