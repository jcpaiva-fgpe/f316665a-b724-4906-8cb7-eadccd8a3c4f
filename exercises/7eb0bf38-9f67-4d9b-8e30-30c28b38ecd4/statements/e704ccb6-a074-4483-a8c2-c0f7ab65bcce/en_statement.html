    <p>
      Consider a board with <i> L </i> lines and <i> C </i> columns. At
      A white ball is placed in one of the columns in the first row.
      shifts vertically along that column and one position at a time.
      In the remaining rows (in any column), balls may be placed
      black (at most one per line), representing projectiles. The balls
      black move only horizontally, one position at a time. The balls
      blacks move from a given initial column and according to a
      initial sense also given. When a black ball reaches the limit of the
      this board reverses the direction of its movement.

    <p>
      Write a program that, given the dimensions of the initial L * C board, the
      column where the white ball is located, the number of black balls and, for
      each black ball, its initial position (row and column) and the direction of
      determine whether the white ball reaches the bottom of the board without
      collide with any of the moving black balls. In the event of a collision, the
      program should print <tt> Collide </tt> and the line corresponding to the ball
      black that collides with the white ball. Otherwise, the program must
      simply print that the ball <tt> Passes </tt>.
