    </div> Usually, in the parking lots of shopping centers,
    parking spaces are arranged in parallel rows, two to
    two, with a circulation strip between each pair of rows. In the most
    sophisticated, there is a traffic light system to facilitate the location
    of free places by drivers who want to park. It's very simple:
    a traffic light is placed over each parking space. When the
    place is free, the traffic light turns green; when it is busy, it stays
    red.
    <p>
      The car park of the future TopaShopping in Loulé will use a
      revolutionary organization of posts, suppressing the bands of
      circulation. I mean, the parking plate will be divided into
      rectangular parking cells, all contiguous, each with a
      semaphore. It is true that, with disrespectful drivers, some cars
      they may be blocked, that is, unable to leave the park. Beyond
      addition, it may happen that certain areas of the park are empty but
      inaccessible, because there are parked cars surrounding this area
      completely. To make life easier for customers who want to park,
      helping them to find a place for the car, traffic lights will be used with
      three colors - green, red and yellow - working as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      At each moment, each of the parking cells will be occupied,
      free, blocking or isolated. Will be busy, with the red traffic light, if
      there is a parked car; will be free, with the green traffic light, if
      it is empty but not blocking or isolated; will be blocking, with the
      yellow traffic light, if empty, but if it was busy, at least
      one of the adjacent cells that are occupied would have the respective
      blocked car; will be isolated, with the traffic light off, if it is free
      but inaccessible from outside the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that a car can be blocked even without being trapped between
      four cars (one in front, one in the back, one on the left and one on the left
      right). Actually being blocked means that adjacent places
      ahead, behind, left and right are all occupied or isolated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also note that, since the car park is not fenced, cars
      parking in the end rows will never be blocked. Beyond
      In addition, you can enter the surface of the park by any of the
      parking cells at the end rows, provided they are empty.
      Soon, these cells will never be isolated.

    </h2> Please write a program that reads from the console the description of the

    measured on the vertical side, and each parking space is represented by
    a pair of coordinates \ (x \), \ (y \), with \ (0 \ leq x <W \) and \ (0
    \ leq y <H \). The traffic light plane is a matrix with \ (H \) lines and
    \ (W \) columns, where each position will have the color of the traffic light of the place

    </div>
    <p> </p>
    <div align = "center"> </div>
    <p>
      Note that the system is practical but not perfect. I mean, it doesn't guarantee
      that a car parked in a green light does not prevent another car
      to leave the park. The system only points out that a car that
      parking in a place with yellow light would block at least one of the
      cars parked in the adjacent places.
