      We are often asked: "When is ToPAS this year?". It's simple. O
      ToPAS is usually on the Friday of the academic week of the University
      Porto, which in turn takes place in the first full week of the month
      of May. That is, it is the Friday of the first week whose Sunday falls
      in May. You can even make a program to determine this date!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only necessary to know how to calculate the day of the week for a date
      calendar represented by <em> year </em>, <em> month </em> and <em> day </em>.
      A simple way to do this is to use the Tondering algorithm and calculate the
      following expression.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <pre>
   (year + year / 4 - year / 100 + year / 400 + Table [month] + day)% 7
</pre>
    <p>
      The value of the expression is an integer between 0 and 6, inclusive, where 0
      interpreted as Sunday, 1 as Monday and so on.
      Before evaluating it, it is necessary to start by subtracting 1 per year if the month
      before March (January or February).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this expression the <tt>% </tt> operator corresponds to the module operation
      (remainder of the entire division), with the divisions also indicated as integers.
      The expression also depends on the month, this function being defined by the table
      that follows.

      For the ToPAS date, which is what you want after all, this formula
      simplifies because May is later than March and the respective value of
      table is zero.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00021000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that works like a ToPAS perpetual calendar, and
      which, given a year, determines the day of the month of May on which this contest has
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data consists of a line with only the integer greater than
      2010 and less than 3000, which identifies the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is also made up of a single line with an integer between
      1 and 31 (inclusive), and that is the day on which the contest takes place in the year
      given away.
