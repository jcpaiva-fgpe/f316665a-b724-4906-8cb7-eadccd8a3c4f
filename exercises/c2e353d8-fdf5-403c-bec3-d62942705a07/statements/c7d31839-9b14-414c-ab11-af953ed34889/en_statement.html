    "right"> A motorway management company has installed a system of
    sensors to count the number of light and heavy vehicles crossing
    each toll road. The system consists of two sensors
    autonomous, one activated by light vehicles and the other by heavy vehicles. Per
    In principle, a vehicle should only activate one of the sensor types, slight
    or heavy. Due to a placement error, the results for each sensor are not
    are reliable if vehicles of the same type pass with a lower interval
    to 10 seconds. Therefore, whenever the heavy-duty sensor detects a
    any vehicle your results are unreliable until you have passed
    10 seconds without registering anything. The same is true with the
    light. <br>
    <br>
    Fortunately, there are records of the sensors with the moment they were
    activated by each type of vehicle and we can assume that they occur in the
    same moment belong to the same vehicle. If the same vehicle is
    simultaneously marked as light and heavy and has passed a heavy
    in the last 10 seconds then we can conclude that it is a slight. In the same
    situation, if a slight has passed in the last 10 seconds then we can
    conclude that it is a heavy one. However, if there is no overlap of
    records at the same time and if the two vehicle registers of the same type
    differ by less than 10 seconds, so the second record is undefined. <br>
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Task </font>
    </h2> Write a program that reads the records from the sensors and returns the
    counting of light, heavy and indefinite vehicles, for this reason
    order. The first line of the input indicates the total number of record lines. Each
    one of the remaining input lines starts at the number of seconds since
    that the sensors were connected, followed by a character indicating the type of
    vehicle detected, "L" (Light) or "P" (Heavy). We can assume that the
    registration lines are ordered in ascending order of the number of
    seconds. <br>
