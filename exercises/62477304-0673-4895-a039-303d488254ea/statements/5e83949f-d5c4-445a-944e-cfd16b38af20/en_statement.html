    <h2>
      Problem
    </h2> Fed up with hearing that they spent the day singing, some cicadas
    decided to imitate their rivals. Not really understanding the logic of displacement
    on paths, we went to find them stunned: having left a certain place
    in single file, began to walk around, systematically passing through
    places where they had previously been, as if they were lost in a
    maze. They finally found the place they intended to reach. In
    anyway, we would like to know what they could have done if they had
    had a better sense of orientation and had not `` visited '' the same
    locations repeatedly.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Assignment
    </h2> Write a program that analyzes the sequence of places that have been
    `` visiting '', which includes the point of departure and the end of arrival, and
    find a route that respects that sequence but removes all turns
    unnecessary. Only the last pass at each of these locations can be
    considered useful. All others are deviations. In case of mistake,
    all the rounds that cicadas gave, since they passed in a given place until
    who returned there, will be considered unnecessary. The place of arrival was not
    visited twice, but any of the rest, including the origin,
    it may have been.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Input
    </h2> It is only given the sequence of places where the cicadas passed by,
    one location per line of data. The last line has a value of 0. The number of
    distinct locations does not exceed 30. Each location is identified by an integer
    positive value less than 10000.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Output
    </h2> The sequence of places they would visit if they had not been mistaken, each
    location on a line.
