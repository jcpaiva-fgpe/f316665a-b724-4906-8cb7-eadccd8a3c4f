      Two friends who haven't seen each other for a few months have met twice
      on the same day at 7:58 and 14:05. One of them exclaimed, `` Only 367 passed
      minutes! '' and the other replied, `` You mean, 6 hours and 7 minutes ?! ''.
      But, if they had met again at 7:59, the first one would say `` Passed
      just 1 minute!''. The second would say `` In fact! ''. I would always say that if the
      interval was less than an hour. If they had met again at
      13:58, the second would say `` You mean, 6 hours ?! '' and if it was at 8:59 already
      it would be `` You mean, 1 hour and 1 minute ?! ''. We intend to write
      dialogues identical to these.
