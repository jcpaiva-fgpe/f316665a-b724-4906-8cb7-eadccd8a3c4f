    <h2>
      Problem
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the interval of classes some students are playing the Secrets, grouped
      in circles with at least three students. A certain element in a circle says
      a secret to your left neighbor. This transmits it to the next and so
      successively until the secret arrives first, sometimes truly
      distorted! The greater the number of elements in the circle, the
      distorted comes the secret.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Assignment
    </h2> Write a program to determine the size of the largest circle in a
    scenario involving <img width = "15" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0"
    src = "img23.gif" alt = "$ n $"> students, numbered from 1 to <img width = "15" height =
    "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img23.gif" alt = "$ n $">, possibly
    grouped in one or more circles (of varying sizes). A sequence is given
    <img width = "103" height = "31" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img26.gif" alt =
    "$ a_1, a_2, \ ldots, a_n $"> where <img width = "21" height = "31" align =
    "middle" border = "0" src = "img27.gif" alt = "$ a_1 $"> is the student who was
    left of student 1, <img width = "21" height = "31" align = "middle" border = "0"
    src = "img28.gif" alt = "$ a_2 $"> is the student who was to the left of student 2, and
    so on.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Input
    </h2> In the first line there is the number of students (it is known that <img width = "64"
    height = "31" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img29.gif" alt = "$ n \ leq 100 $">).
    In the following lines there is the sequence <img width = "103" height = "31" align =
    "middle" border = "0" src = "img26.gif" alt = "$ a_1, a_2, \ ldots, a_n $"> that
    sets the stage.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Output
    </h2> Will write the largest number of students in a circle, followed by a change of
    line.
