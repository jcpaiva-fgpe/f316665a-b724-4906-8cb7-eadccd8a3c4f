      border = "0"> The Game of Life is not a "conventional" game. Do not exist
      players, neither can win or lose. And once the pieces are placed,
      seemingly simple rules determine everything that will happen to
      follow, with very complex behaviors, full of surprises!
    </p>
    <p>
      This game is played on a checkered board. Each grid (or
      cell) may be <i> dead </i> or <i> alive </i>. We mark a cell
      live with the character <tt> '#' </tt> and a dead cell with the character
      <tt> '.' </tt>. In this sense, a starting board valid for the game of
      life would be for example:
    </p>
    <pre>
.........
.........
.... # ....
... ### ...
... #. # ...
.... # ....
.........
.........
</pre>
    <p>
      Each cell has 8 neighboring cells (except the cells at the limit of the
      board), which are the adjacent squares in all directions
      (including diagonals). Given an initial configuration, the board will
      evolving with the application of rules. So, for each cell, we count the
      number of neighbors with living cells and what happens next depends
      of this number:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors <i> is born </i>,
      staying alive in the next step;
      </li>
      <li> A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors <i> survives </i>, remaining
      live in the next step;
      </li>
      <li> In all other cases, a cell <i> dies </i> (if it was alive),
      or remains dead.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note that this rule is applied to all cells at the same time, that is,
      to determine what happens at a given step we have to
      check what happens to each cell before we actually do the
      changes that the rules determine. For example, for the given board
      above, the application of the rules led to the following steps (and then
      would continue):
    </p>

    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Task </font>
    </h2> Write a program that, given an initial configuration of the
    game of life, get the status of that same board after one
    number of steps.
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Input </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the first line of <i> input </i> there are 3 whole numbers <b> L </b>,
      <b> C </b> and <b> P </b> (separated by spaces), indicating respectively the
      number of lines on the board, the number of columns and the number of steps to be
      use. You can assume that 1 ≤ L, C ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ P ≤ 250 ;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Follow exactly <b> L </b> lines, each containing exactly
      <b> C </b> characters, indicating the initial state of the board
      (<tt> '#' </tt> for a living cell, and <tt> '.' </tt> for a cell
      dead).
    </p>
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Output </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <i> output </i> consists of <b> L </b> lines, each with <b> C </b>
      characters, indicating the state of the board after <b> P </b> steps of
      application of the rules. The characters to be used are the same as the
      <i> input </i>.
