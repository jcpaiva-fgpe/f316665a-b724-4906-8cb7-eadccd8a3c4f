      "Clean, clean ..." - Football or sad fado? At ToPAS 2013, Calimero
      I was looking for a way out of a tunnel. Are you now partying or in trouble? Let's go
      follow in his footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that you are somewhere in a rectangular, discreet domain, by the sea
      planted. Try to manage your savings. Follow strict instructions:
      movements towards South (<b> S </b>), North (<b> N </b>), East (<b> E </b>), or
      West (<b> W </b>), from a number of positions. Along the way, win
      some money, which goes towards expenses only. The worst are the
      rates (<b> T </b>) that surprise you on the way and that instantly
      take 10% of current savings from you. In fact, it may not be as much
      because these losses are always close to the units and never exceed 10%
      these savings. With any luck, find some investment (<b> I </b>) that
      will instantly allow you to replenish 5% of current savings (with
      approximation to the units and without exceeding 5% of these savings).
    </p>
    <p>
      Between luck and misfortune, he walks, sometimes bewildered (changing his
      North to South) for having hit hard (<b> X </b>). After such
      hit, proceeds immediately, disoriented, only recovering with a
      another strong blow (<b> X </b>) or a big scare (for almost drowning).
      If it recovers during a South / North movement, it immediately reverses the
      sense, and proceeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, he receives instructions to emigrate, leaving the rectangular domain
      by a border (<b> A </b>). But it doesn't go west or south, because
      you don't want to drown. Before entering the ocean, always interrupt the
      movement (and, with the fright, it even recovers the north, if necessary!),
      awaiting further instruction. Outside or inside follow precise instructions.
      When he is away, he is able to reinforce savings (10 monetary units
      for each position you visit, even in transit) and has no fees or
      investments. When he emigrates, he hopes that one day he will be able to return. But in the
      border (North and East), there are beasts (<b> F </b>) that can annihilate you
      if you have the misfortune to bump into someone, in an outward movement or
      entry, or abroad (over the border).
    </p>

    </h2> Write a program to follow Calimero's steps, in the execution
    guidelines received and, if not annihilated, determine your position
    and the final value of your savings.

    </h2> The first line has three integers, \ (s \), \ (m \) and \ (n \), with \ (0 \ leq
    s <
    1000 \) and \ (m, n <20 \), which represent the initial savings and the number
    of rows and columns of the table that defines the <em> rectangular domain </em>.
    Below is the table, formed by $ m $ sequences of \ (n \) capital letters,
    <b> T </b>, <b> I </b>, <b> X </b>, <b> A </b>, <b> F </b>, with the above meaning,
    and <b> V </b> (empty). The South and West have only <b> A </b> 's. The North and East have
    <b> A </b> 's and <b> F </b>' s. Inside there is <b> T </b>, <b> I </b>, <b> X </b> or
    <b> V </b> 's. <br>
    After the table, you have the number of movements to make and, finally, the
    description of each movement, given by a character (S, N, E, W) followed by a
    digit (0, ..., 9) which is the offset. <br>
    At the beginning, Calimero is inside the domain, in the lower left corner.
    This position has coordinates (1,1) and contains <b> V </b>. Over the border, already
    It is out. Points with abscissa or ordinate zero are in the ocean. At
    coordinates of the positions visited abroad are always positive. O
    referential is the canonical. The number of movements to be made does not exceed 100.
