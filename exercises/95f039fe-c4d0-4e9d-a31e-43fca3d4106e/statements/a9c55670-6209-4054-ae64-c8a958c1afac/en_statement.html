      João and his friends are creating an app to help save money on
      cost of motor fuels. At this point the app is already able to obtain
      the price per liter of fuel in all pumps located in a
      certain radius, as well as the distance they are. The problem is
      that the pump with the best price is often so far away that saving
      would dissipate in the cost of travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      João's task is to determine the gas pump to recommend to the
      driver who uses the app, knowing how much they want to fill and which
      the average consumption of the car. For simplicity, it is assumed that after
      refuel, the driver returns to the starting point.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00031000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Given the amount of gasoline you intend to supply and the consumption of
      car, and also a list of filling stations with indication of the
      its distance from the current point and the price per liter of fuel,
      determine the gas pump that allows a lower cost per liter
      effective (in cents, rounded by default).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em> effective cost per liter </em> also accounts for the cost of
      travel to the gas station (round trip). So, if you want to
      fill 50 liters but have to travel 5 kilometers to the pump, and
      another 5 to return, and the car uses 10 liters of gasoline for each
      100 kilometers (that is, 1 liter for every 10 km) so, in the end, it was
      as if he had only 49 liters of the 50 he supplied. To the
      49.5 liters actually available at the end, it is necessary to add the medium
      liter you spent on the way. If the price per liter charged at the pump is
      1.30 euros would then pay 65 euros for the 50 liters, so the price per
      effective liter was 132 cents, which would correspond to paying 65 euros
      by 49 liters. In the estimate, it is assumed that the price of gasoline that
      you have in the tank before filling is equal to what you would pay. The cost per
      effective liter is obtained by rounding to the largest integer not
      higher (for example, <em> 132.7 </em> and <em> 132.1 </em> cents would be
      both rounded to 132 cents).
    </p>

    <p>
      The starting line contains two integers: the first is the quantity to be
      fuel (in liters) and the second the consumption of the car (liters for each
      100 km). The second line contains an <em> n </em> integer that indicates the number
      of gas stations to be considered, being <em> 1 <n <2000 </em>.
      Each of the following <em> n </em> lines has two integers, referring to
      a pump: the distance it is (in meters) and the price per liter
      of fuel (in cents). It is assumed that this fuel is what the
      driver intends to use.

      The number of the pump to recommend, in the order in which they are listed in the

      a pump with the <em> best effective price </em>, will be presented the one that
