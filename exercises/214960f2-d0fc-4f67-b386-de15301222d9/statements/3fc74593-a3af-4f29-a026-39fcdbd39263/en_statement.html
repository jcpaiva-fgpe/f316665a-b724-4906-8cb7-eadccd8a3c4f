      Jo√£o got tired of the monotonous floor of his room, all in wooden slats
      chestnut, and decided to replace it with something more cheerful. As you learned ago
      bit the RGB color model - R for <em> red </em>, red, G for
      <em> green </em>, green, and B for <em> blue </em>, blue - chose to do it
      a floor with mosaics of these three fundamental colors, with the
      certain that his mother would not object.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order not to get lost in operations, he planned the work carefully, like this:
      starting at one of the corners, place a red mosaic there; then to
      around that red mosaic, a row of green mosaics; then to
      around the row of green mosaics, a row of blue mosaics; later,
      a row of red mosaics; and so on, until the ground is
      all covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above drawings illustrate the state of the floor after the second row
      green and after it is already complete. In this case, the room has a length
      10 and width 8.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question is: to cover the entire floor, how many mosaics of each color should the
      John buy?
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00011000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Write a program that, given the length and width of the room,
    calculate the number of red, green and blue mosaics needed to
    cover the bedroom floor using the diagram shown. The mosaics are
    squares and the side measures one unit.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00012000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> A line with two integers: the first is the length of the
    fourth and the second the width. Both are greater than zero and less than or
    equal to 10,000.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00013000000000000000"> Output </a>
    </h2> There will be a line where three whole numbers appear, separated by a
    space: the first represents the number of red mosaics, the second the
    number of green mosaics and the third the number of blue mosaics.
