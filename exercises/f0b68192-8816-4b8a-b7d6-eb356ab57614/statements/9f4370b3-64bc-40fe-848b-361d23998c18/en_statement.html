      We just ran into a serious problem with our files
      digital, still based on CD-ROM and some on floppy disks. Many
      files are corrupted and it is not possible to fully recover the
      your information. Fortunately, there are many copies of each
      this we think it will be possible to recover most of the files.

      The recovery strategy is simple: analyzing bit by bit the various
      copies of the same file we will take the most bit for each position
      frequent. In case of equal frequency for a given bit, the
      <code> 0 </code> value. For example, if we have 4 files with the
      following 6-bit strings the recovery result will be as indicated
      on the last line

      To simplify your work, the files have been converted into a
      string <code> 0 </code> and <code> 1 </code>. The first line
      input will consist of N and M, where N is the number of "files" and M
      is the number of "bits" of each file. The next N lines are
      strings of M characters containing only the characters
      <code> 0 </code> or <code> 1 </code>. It is known that N does not exceed 30 and M does not
      exceeds 255.
