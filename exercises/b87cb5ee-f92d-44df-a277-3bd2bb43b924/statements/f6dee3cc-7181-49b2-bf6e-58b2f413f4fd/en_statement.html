      Problem
    </h2>
    <p>
      A given motorway concessionaire intends to install a
      emergency telephone network. However, due to the exorbitant price of
      electrical cables in recent times, the concessionaire is trying to
      solve the problem of sending electricity to phones in a way
      that does not force it to lay cables along the entire motorway. Although
      widely adopted on other motorways, in this area the panels
      solar panels are not an option as it is permanently bad weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, all is not lost. Recently, a new
      wireless electricity transmission technology that, using
      very sophisticated directional antennas allow the direct sending of all the
      signal to a given phone whenever it initiates a call. With
      this electricity transmission technology, the electrical power
      only one unit decreases for every kilometer the signal travels.

    </div> Despite being enthusiastic about the idea, those responsible, zealous for
    For security reasons, they are intended to confirm that all
    emergency will have enough electricity to operate.
    <h2>
      Assignment
    </h2> Write a program that given the positions of the antennas and the phones
    and its powers (of emission of the antennas and of operation of the
    phones), check whether the phones can work or not. a phone
    simultaneously receive signals from several antennas, the power being
    total received equal to the sum of the powers received from each antenna.
    Assume that no more than one phone will be used at the same time.
