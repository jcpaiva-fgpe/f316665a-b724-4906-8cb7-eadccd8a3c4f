    </h2> Jo達o has always liked mathematics. One day he bought a
    calculator and spent long hours trying it out, trying to figure out
    all its features. At a certain point, as a joke, Jo達o
    began to rotate the calculator in his hand. When he ran the calculator 180
    degrees, he noticed that he was still able to read a number on the display.
    Interestingly, the number was the same that could be read when the calculator
    it was not rotated! This happened with the number "1691" and it is clear that the
    Jo達o was immediately wondering if that would happen with more numbers. Knowing
    that you are a good programmer, Jo達o decided to ask you for help ... <img width =
    "623" height = "298" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img1.gif" alt =
    "\ epsffile {calculator.eps}">

      <a name="SECTION00002000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Given a number (shown on a calculator display), your program
    you have to say whether that same number can still be read when the
    calculator is rotated 180 degrees. The calculator's display consists of a
    normal LCD display, as shown in the figure.
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00003000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> The first line contains an N number (1 <img width = "31" height = "31"
    align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img2.gif" alt = "$ <= $"> N <img width = "31"
    height = "31" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img2.gif" alt = "$ <= $"> 100) that
    represents the number of numbers that the program must analyze. Each one
    of the following N lines contains a number with a maximum of 500 digits.
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00004000000000000000"> Output </a>
    </h2> For each number analyzed, the program must write a line of
    output, containing "YES" if the number remains the same when the
    calculator is rotated, and "NOT" otherwise.
