    </div> It is intended to cut a piece of tape similar to the one in the following figure
    across so that all the pieces have exactly the same
    standard. The ribbon design consists of <tt> * </tt>, <tt>? </tt> and
    <tt> T </tt>. The <tt> T </tt> 's bar always exists because it forms the shot of the
    fabric, but only occurs on one side, as in the example. Besides, there is no more
    <tt> T </tt> 's in the drawing. Cuts cannot break the reasons <tt> * </tt>
    nor <tt>? </tt> in half.

      What is the <b> greatest number </b> of equal pieces that can be obtained? Like
      there are several tapes of the same type to analyze, some wider than
      others, some longer than others, we will try to automate the
      process.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Task </font>
    </h2> Write a program that, given the description of the tape to be cut, indicates the
    maximum number of equal pieces that can be obtained by applying cuts
    transversal (in the direction of the width, that is, perpendicular to the line of
    shot).
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Input </font>
    </h2> In the first line two integers <b> L </b> and <b> C </b> representing the
    tape width and length respectively. The width and the
    length correspond to the number of rows of symbols. You can assume that the
    <b> L </b> never exceeds 8 and <b> C </b> does not exceed 10000. On lines
    The following is the description of each line of the tape (depending on the width). O
    <tt> T </tt> character exists only at the end of each line and will not count towards the
    tape width.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Output </font>
    </h2> You will write an integer that indicates the number of pieces you would get
    (followed by line break).
