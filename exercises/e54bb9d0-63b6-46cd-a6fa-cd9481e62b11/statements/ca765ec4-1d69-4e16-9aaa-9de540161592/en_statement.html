      In the game <i> Rock, Paper, Scissors </i>, two players form
      simultaneously one of three hand signals: the Stone is symbolized by a
      closed fist; the Paper, by the open hand; and the scissors, by two fingers
      stretched. Players compare the signals, to decide who won, from
      as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> the Stone wins the Scissors (kneading it);
      </li>
      <li> the Scissors wins the Paper (cutting it);
      </li>
      <li> the Paper wins the Stone (wrapping it).
      </li>
    </ul> If both players make the same gesture, a tie occurs.
    Usually the game is repeated until someone wins or by a number
    predetermined number of moves.

      <a name="SECTION00021000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Given the signal sequences of two players in 10 moves,
    it is intended to count the number of victories for each one. Each sequence is
    given in a line and consists of 10 letters of three types: <b> R </b>
    (Stone), <b> P </b> (Paper) or <b> T </b> (Scissors). The result should
    consist of two lines of text accounting for the number of
    first and second player wins.
