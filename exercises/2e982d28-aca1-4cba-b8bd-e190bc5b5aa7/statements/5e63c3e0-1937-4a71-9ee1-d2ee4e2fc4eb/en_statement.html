      Who doesn't know the famous Tetris game? When in the years 1985 and 1986
      Alexey Pajitnov and Dmitry Pavlovsky, two programmers at the Center for
      Computing of the Russian Academy of Sciences, invented the game, inspired
      in the idea of ​​pieces falling into a glass cup, they never imagined success
      that this one would come to have. And to think that the first version of the game had only
      4 colors and a resolution of 320x200!

    <p>
      Your task is to create a program to simulate a game of
      Tetris. You can assume that, as illustrated in the figure, the
      game is always a checkered matrix of 15 rows by 8 columns. At
      pieces are small sets of connected squares that fall with the force of the
      gravity, stopping when any of its parts touches another part or
      at the end of the board. When a line is completely filled,
      disappears, and all the lines above it fall, moving
      one line down. For each completed line, the player wins one
      series of points and goes up in level, with the pieces falling
      each time faster. but this final part doesn’t interest you and what
      you are asked for is a program that, given a sequence of parts, as well as the
      where they fall, tell us how the final board configuration looks.
      Initially, the board is always completely empty.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00003000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first line of input has a number <img width = "20" height = "15"
      align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img2.gif" alt = "$ N $"> (<img width = "129"
      height = "32" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img3.gif" alt =
      "$ 1 <= N <= 100 $">) which tells you the number of pieces in the sequence,
      followed by <img width = "20" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src =
      "img2.gif" alt = "$ N $"> lines describing the pieces, in order of fall.
      Each piece is described in a line with 3 numbers: <img width = "58" height =
      "32" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img4.gif" alt = "$ DIM_X $">, <img width =
      "57" height = "32" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img5.gif" alt = "$ DIM_Y $">
      and <img width = "20" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img6.gif"
      alt = "$ X $"> (<img width = "104" height = "32" align = "middle" border = "0" src =
      "img7.gif" alt = "$ 1 <= DIM_X $">, <img width = "102" height = "32" align =
      "middle" border = "0" src = "img8.gif" alt = "$ DIM_Y <= 4 $">; <img width =
      "111" height = "32" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img9.gif" alt =
      "$ 1 <= X <= 8 $">) indicating the number of lines and
      columns of the piece and the leftmost column number of the piece, which indicates
      where the piece falls. These 3 numbers are followed by <img width = "57" height =
      "32" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img5.gif" alt = "$ DIM_Y $"> lines, each
      one with <img width = "58" height = "32" align = "middle" border = "0" src =
      "img4.gif" alt = "$ DIM_X $"> characters, indicating the configuration of the part.
      A '#' means a filled square and a '.' means a space in
      White.

    </h2>
    <p>
      The output consists of 15 lines, each with 8 characters,
      indicating the final configuration of the board. As in the input, a '#'
      means a filled square and a '.' means a blank space.
