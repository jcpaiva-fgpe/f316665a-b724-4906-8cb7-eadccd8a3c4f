      Communication networks are increasingly busy and applications
      require an increase in bandwidth. In order to optimize the
      use of networks and being able to transport as many bytes as possible
      on the same connections, network coding (<em> network) was developed
      coding </em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      In network coding, data is not sent exactly as it is generated
      by the applications, but combinations of pieces of that data are sent.
      As long as the combinations of pieces received are independent,
      it is possible to recover the original data. An example of an operator for
      these combinations (a "combiner") is the XOR (\ (\ oplus \)), which
      matches <em> or-exclusive </em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interesting thing about XOR is its logical property that that \ (p \ oplus p =
      0 \). That is, when we apply the operation to the same element (value)
      we get zero. And when we operate with zero we get the given value, i.e.,
      \ (p \ oplus 0 = p \). So if we have \ (p \) and \ (r \) we have:
    </p>
    <div align = "center">
      <img src = "img40.gif" alt = "[missing alt]">
    </div> <br clear="all">
    <p> </p>
    <p>
      In the figure, we can see how some savings are achieved in messages
      sent. The sending nodes each have different data (\ (p \) and \ (r \))
      to send to both receiving nodes. On connection A, using the
      network encoding, we just need to send a message with \ (
      p \ oplus r \) instead of sending two separate messages \ (p \) and \ (r \).
      And, the receiving nodes are able to decode the \ (p \) and \ (r \) using the
      indicated properties.

    </h2> This problem asks you to put your mathematical minds to work
    to develop a program that gives a list of messages received,
    decode as much of the individual data as possible. The following
    combinations of data in the various messages received. As output they must be
    The individual data that has been successfully decoded (for example,
    alphabetical order). Each letter (always lowercase) represents a given
    different. The various messages are provided on separate lines, and each
    The message may contain a combination of several letters.

    message. In each message, the letters are distinct and, globally, are not
    more than 10 different letters are used.
