      The voice acts as a fingerprint to identify each
      individual, like the iris or its DNA. Its features
      are determined either by the way the vocal cords vibrate or by
      by patterns resulting from other physical aspects of the individual. Like
      would be the story of Ali Baba if the treasure cave was protected
      by a biometric system based on voice recognition? It would not be enough
      pronounce the magic formula "Open yourself Sesame". But, he would be able to take
      some advantage of the fact that the authentication system uses measures
      probabilistic and, consequently, being able to make wrong decisions (the
      <em> false positives </em> that would serve your interests)?

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00041000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> The intention is to analyze a sequence of interactions between Ali Baba and
    biometric system of the cave and write a program to determine the
    maximum number of times in a row that managed to open the door without
    difficulties. The program will analyze a record of occurrences in which <code> 1
    1 </code> designates <em> opening without problems </em> and <code> 1 0 </code> a
    <em> failure </em>. After a failure there will always be a sequence of
    zero or more failed attempts (each represented by <code> 0 </code>)
    which will end with <code> 1 </code> (success) or <code> 2 </code>
    (withdrawal). Each input line has one occurrence, with the exception of
    of the last line which is always <code> -1 -1 </code>. The output will be a line
    with the requested amount.
