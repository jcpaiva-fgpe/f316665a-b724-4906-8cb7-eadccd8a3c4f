      Problem
    </h2>
    <p>
      In an athletics event, not yet introduced in the world competitions for
      lack of consensus, the classification of each team is given by the number of
      elements that reached the goal and the time of arrival of the last. It is used
      a tiebreaker when athletes from different teams cross the
      goal at the same time and the teams they belong to have also finished the
      race with the same number of athletes. If the recorded image does not allow you to see
      which athlete stretched his neck the most, the total weight of the elements of the
      team is used to untie them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each team consists of three athletes. It is possible that some athletes
      give up. The teams in which they are ranked are ranked in the top places.
      more athletes managed to finish the race. A team is not classified
      if none of your athletes cross the goal.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Assignment
    </h2>
    <p>
      Writing a program that gives a sequence of arrivals determines the order
      classification of teams (in which at least one athlete has finished the
      proof).
    </p>
    <h2>
      Input
    </h2> The first row has the number of teams registered for the race. At
    remaining lines contain the sequence of arrival of the athletes (already
    ties). Each value identifies only the number of the team to which
    belongs to the athlete who arrived in the corresponding position. Data ends
    with -1.
    <p>
      Teams are identified by consecutive integers greater than or equal
      a 1. There are no more than 200 teams.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Output
    </h2> As many lines as the number of teams ranked: the first
    line indicates the number of the team that came first, the second will be
    the classified second and so on. At the end he writes the
    number of unclassified teams, preceded by the message `` <code> No.
    dropouts (whole team): </code> Â¨. All lines end with a change of
    line.
