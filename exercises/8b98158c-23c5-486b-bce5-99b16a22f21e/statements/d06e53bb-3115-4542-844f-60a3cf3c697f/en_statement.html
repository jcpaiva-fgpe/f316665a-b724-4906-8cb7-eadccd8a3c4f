    Write a program that reads the scores of the players and writes the order
    relative between these. The scoring table is given: 4 lines; each row
    has the 6 scores of a player (they are positive integers). The program must
    write a single line with the relative order among the players, of the best
    for the worst ranked. There will be no draws. We identify the players
    by numbers from 1 to 4: player 1 has the scores on the first line, the
    player 2 the second, etc.
