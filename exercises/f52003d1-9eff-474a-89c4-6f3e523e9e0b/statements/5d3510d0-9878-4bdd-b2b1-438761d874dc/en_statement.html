      The cock game is played with two players on a 3 * 3 board.
      Each player alternately places one of his pieces in one of the positions
      unfilled. The player who manages to put 3 of his pieces in wins
      line horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The game ends as soon as a
      of the players win or when all positions are occupied,
      situation is considered a tie.
