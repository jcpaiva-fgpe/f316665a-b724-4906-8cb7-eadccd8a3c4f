      Problem
    </h2> A well-known multinational <em> software </em>, who prefers
    remain anonymous, was the victim of a computer attack on the repository of
    code for the next version of one of your most widespread products. You
    <em> crackers </em> introduced a series of viruses that were thus
    first propagated through licensed <em> software </em>!
    <p>
      The attack was so well done that it was not yet possible to determine its
      origin. It is only known that the authors will have gained access to the network of
      company using one or more company employee accounts. Comparing
      the modification dates of the altered files, a
      time interval in which the attack was carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment all company employees are suspicious, the mood is
      unsustainable and the investigation of this incident does not proceed. To reduce the
      number of suspects it was proposed to compare the authentication records of
      employees. These records indicate the date and time of either the start or
      at the end of each work session. An employee will be suspicious if a
      of their work sessions overlap with the period in which the
      attack. Therefore, a session will be suspect if it starts before the end
      the attack and finish after the attack begins.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Assignment
    </h2> Write a program to determine the <b> number </b> of suspects who
    would be located in this way.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Input
    </h2> In the first line of the data, there are the initial and final instants of the
    attack. Then an integer <em> n </em> follows with the number of sessions to be
    process. The following <em> n </em> lines describe the sessions, ordered
    time: in each line there is the employee's number, the beginning and end of the
    respective session.
    <p>
      The company has no more than 100 employees. In the data provided, the
      moments of the beginning and end of the attack and of the sessions, are
      negative (representable in 32 bits). The times are all indicated in
      seconds, corresponding to an interval that has elapsed since a certain
      initial instant.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Output
    </h2>
    <p>
      The program output is limited to the number of suspects detected (ends
      by line change)
