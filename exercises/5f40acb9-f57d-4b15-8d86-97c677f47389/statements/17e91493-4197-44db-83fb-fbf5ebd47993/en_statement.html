      We had the Europa League semi-final second leg matches yesterday. THE
      date we wrote, we still don't know the results of the games, but,
      if everything went well, we will have two Portuguese teams in the final, the
      which is truly fantastic. At this stage, the Europa League is a tournament
      to eliminate and in each tie there are two games between each pair of
      teams, first in the field of one of them, then in the field of the other. Win
      the elimination round and the team that makes it to the next round (or the final)
      has scored more goals in the aggregate, that is, in the set of the two games.
      In the event of a tie in the aggregate, the team that has scored the most passes
      goals away, that is, in the game on the opponent's field. This criterion of
      tiebreaker is not enough, as it may happen that both teams
      have scored the same number of goals away. In the event of a tie in the
      aggregate and in the away goals, already counting on the extra time that will have
      occurred in the second leg game, the elimination is resolved using
      kicks on the penalty mark. In slang, we say <em> "go to
      penalties "</em>.

      <a name="SECTION00011000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> It is true that the accounts are easy and are done in the head, but the system
    information system (organization that organizes the Europa League) has to calculate
    automatically who moves on to the next round, depending on the
    results of the two games. We intend to program this module of the
    system: given the results of the two games of a tie, calculate the
    team that won the tie.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00012000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> The first line has two character strings, each of which is formed
    only by letters and by the character '<code> _ </code>', and the two separated one from
    another for a space. The first word represents the name of the team that
    plays at home in the first leg (and away in the second); the second word
    represents the name of the team that plays away in the first leg (and at home in the
    Monday). The second line has two non-negative integers, which
    represent the result of the first leg game and the third row is
    analogous, but for the result of the second leg. In both cases the first
    number indicates the number of goals scored by the home team and the
    according to the number of goals scored by the away team.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00013000000000000000"> Output </a>
    </h2> There is only one line where only a string appears with the
    name of the team that wins the tie, if the tie has been
    resolved without resorting to penalties, or the word <code> penaltis </code>,
    without quotes and without accent, in case there is a tie in the aggregate and goals
    marked off.
