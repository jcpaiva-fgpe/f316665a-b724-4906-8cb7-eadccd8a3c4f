      <font color = "blue"> Problem </font>
    </h2> One of the attractions of a popular fair is the launch of balls of rags
    to objects strategically placed so that they can hardly be
    overturned. A group of friends acquired <b> N </b> balls so that each
    perform exactly <b> J </b> or <b> J + 1 </b> launches. Each ball
    is launched only once. How many elements does the group have at most? How many
    make <b> J </b> launches and how many make <b> J + 1 </b>?
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Task </font>
    </h2> Write a program that, given a sequence of pairs (<b> N </b>,
    <b> J </b>) ending in 0 0, each of which corresponds to a scenario,
    answer the previous three questions. <b> N </b> is known to be greater than or equal
    that <b> J </b> and does not exceed 10000.
