      A timeline is a phrase that can be read as a date. The word
      Portuguese derives from the Greek words "chronos" (tempo) and "grama"
      (letter). Although nowadays the word "schedule" has acquired a
      new connotation - that of a diagram representing the temporal evolution - in
      time, the timelines were simply phrases that hid a
      date. The schedules were inscribed on monuments and tombs as a
      poetic way of alluding to the dates they evoke. Instead of simply
      write the date in Roman numerals, as was the norm at that time, the
      letters of the Roman numerals were used in the middle of the words of a sentence,
      mixed with other letters that have no meaning as numerals
      Romans. For example, from the phrase
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <div align = "center">
      A <b> M </b> OR <b> M </b> A <b> XI </b>
    </div>
    <p>
      you can extract the characters from the Roman numeral MMXI that are equivalent to the
      number 2011. As we all know, Roman numerals are decimal based,
      like Arabic, but it is not positional. Each letter has a value and the value of
      number is based on the sum of the value of the letters that compose it. For the most
      the following table recalls the correspondence between letters
      and its value.

    <p>
      In Roman numerals the letters are usually written in order
      decreasing in value. For example 1500 is written as MD and never as
      DM. The letters corresponding to powers of 10 (I, X, C and M) can
      be repeated up to 3 times. The subtractive principle can also be used
      to simplify some representations. So IV is written instead of
      IIII, and IX instead of VIIII, for example. The use of the principle
      subtractive is limited to values ​​of the next quantity. We can use an I
      before a V or an X, an X before an L or a C, or a C before a D
      or an M; but never an I before a C or an M, or an X before a D
      or an M. For example, it makes no sense to write MIM for 1999 that
      should be written as MCMXCIX.

      It is intended a program that receives as input a line with a
      sequence of words that eventually contains a timeline of value
      less than 3999, and produce a line with the corresponding number in
      arabic notation. Since the Romans did not use lowercase letters, we assume that
      the words are sequences of one or more capital letters and that the timelines
      maximum of 100 characters. If none of the letters I, V, X, L, C, D, and M
      occurs, then the resulting line will have a value of 0. Otherwise, it will have the
      value corresponding to the Roman numeral, which is supposed to always be well
      defined.
