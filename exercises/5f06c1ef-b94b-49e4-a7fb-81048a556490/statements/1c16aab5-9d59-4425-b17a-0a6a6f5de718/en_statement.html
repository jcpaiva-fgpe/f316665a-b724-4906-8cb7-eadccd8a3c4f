    <p>
      In the board game <em> Color Lines </em>, the objective is to line up five or
      more balls of the same color, as many times as you can, to
      score points. The board has a dimension <img width = "43" height = "31"
      align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img6.gif" alt = "$ 9 \ times 9 $">. O
      alignment can be vertical, horizontal or any diagonal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Normally the game starts with five balls on the board positioned at the
      chance. In each play, the player selects any ball and the position
      where you want to move it. The ball moves to that position as long as it
      be free and there is a free way there (that path is always a
      sequence of any horizontal and / or vertical unit steps). At
      new position, the ball may complete one or more alignments, each
      with 5 or more balls (as in the examples). Whenever this happens, the
      player accumulates points and the balls involved leave the board. Just leave
      balls belonging to an alignment of 5 or more balls. In the situation
      illustrated by the figure on the far right, would complete an alignment of 6
      balls and one of 5 (and 10 balls would come out of the board).
    </p>
    <p>
      When there is no alignment, new balls enter, occupying positions
      random. The game ends when the board runs out of space
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is only intended to know if the player is able to complete any
      alignment in a given play and, if successful, how many balls will come out of the
      board (before others enter).

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00071000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Write a program to simulate a move from a certain state
    and indicate how many balls leave the board in that move.
    <p>
      Each position on the board is identified by a pair (I, J) of integers
      between 1 and 9, where I is the row number and J is the column number: (1,1), (1,9), (9,9)
      and (9.1) are the bottom left, bottom right, top
      right and upper left, respectively. In each position there is a
      integer (from 1 to 7).
    </p>
    <p>
      The input starts with the state of the board, given by lines, from the top to the
      base (0 means free position). The next two lines give the position
      the selected ball and the cell to move it to, if you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output is a line with the number of balls that have come out (possibly 0).
    </p>
    <p>
      The following examples refer to the plays outlined in the two
      figures to the left (the colors light blue, dark blue, green,
      red, orange, pink, and yellow are represented by integers from 1 to
      7).
