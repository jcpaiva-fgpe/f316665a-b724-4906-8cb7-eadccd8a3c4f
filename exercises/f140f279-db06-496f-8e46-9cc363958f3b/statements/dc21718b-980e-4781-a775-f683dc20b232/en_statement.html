      The metric system was adopted in Portugal just over one hundred and
      sixty years, more precisely in 1852, during the reign of D. Maria II.
      Before the meter, the length units used in Portugal came from the
      middle ages and were similar to those still common in some countries
      Anglo-Saxon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The previous system, before D. Maria II, was based on the <em> span </em>,
      that corresponded more or less to the distance between the tip of the thumb and the
      little finger tip on an open hand. In addition to the span, there was the
      <em> cubit </em>, which are 3 spans, and the <em> rod </em>, which are
      5 hands. Above the pole was the <em> fathom </em>, which are two
      sticks. On the other hand, below the span was <em> inch </em>: 8
      inches span. Again above the span, we had <em> foot </em>,
      which are 12 inches, the <em> step </em>, which is 5 feet, and the
      <em> toesa </em>, which is 6 feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, we had eight units and not all of them were multiple or
      submultiples of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      For us, so used to meters, kilometers, centimeters, the system
      medieval looks very complicated, but surely our great-great-grandparents
      they didn't get in the way.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that, given a length measurement expressed in
      span, cubits, rods, fathoms, inches, feet, steps and toesas, calculate
      the expression of this measure only using sticks, hands and inches. At the
      result, the number of inches must be less than the number of inches
      in a span and the number of spans must be less than the number of spans in a
      stick.

    <p>
      A line containing eight non-negative integers, representing the
      length measurement we want to analyze: first is the number of
      fathoms, the second is the number of toesas, the third is the number of steps,
      the fourth is the number of rods, the fifth is the number of cubits, the sixth is the
      number of feet, the seventh is the number of hands and the eighth is the number of
      inches.

    </h2> A line containing three non-negative numbers, represented by the measure
    in length using only sticks, hands and inches: the first number is
    the number of sticks, the second is the number of spans and the third is the number
    of inches.
