      Congratulations! You have been admitted to the GIS (Security Interest Group).
      Your first task is to implement the strong authentication system
      required by the authentication of our website. We don't use keywords.
      To authenticate you, you will be presented with a challenge that will have to be
      replied in 10 milliseconds, without fail and at the first attempt. This
      means that the challenge will have to be answered by a program that will have
      to install on your authentication client. This program receives a
      string as a challenge and responds with another string
      of characters.

    </h2>
    <p>
      The challenges will be changed weekly. In this first week the
      The answer to the challenge will be the character string provided with the
      characters in index positions <img width = "40" height = "14" align =
      "bottom" border = "0" src = "img1.gif" alt = "$ 2 * n $"> exchanged with
      characters in index positions <img width = "70" height = "31" align =
      "middle" border = "0" src = "img2.gif" alt = "$ 2 * n + 1 $">, 0 being the first
      sequence index, for <img width = "93" height = "36" align = "middle"
      border = "0" src = "img3.gif" alt = "$ 0 \ leq n <l / 2 $">, where <img width =
      "10" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img4.gif" alt = "$ l $">,
      string length, is an even number between 2 and 100,
      including.
