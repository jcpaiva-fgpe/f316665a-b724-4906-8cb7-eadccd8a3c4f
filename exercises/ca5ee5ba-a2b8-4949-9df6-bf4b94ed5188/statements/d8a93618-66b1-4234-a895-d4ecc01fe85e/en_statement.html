      To find the store of a certain type that is as close as possible
      possible from where we are we can use an <em> app </em> for our
      mobile phone. That is what Manuel and his classmates thought.
      So they decide to develop such an application for smart phone
      (aka <em> smart-phone </em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      As they are organized they decided to divide the program into several modules,
      each one being responsible for a part. In the end they would integrate them into a
      application. Manuel decided to implement the module to determine the location
      of the request type that is the shortest distance from the user. The
      coordinates of the location where the user is and the type of store that
      intended, as well as a description of existing locations. For each location,
      coordinates and type are given (restaurant, shopping center, bar,
      coffee, etc.). If there are multiple locations of the desired type at the same
      distance, it should indicate what happened first in the data list.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00011000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Write the program to process the data and respond to the request.
    The coordinates of each location, relative to the same reference
    (orthonormal), are defined by a pair of integers. The location type is
    identified by a sequence of capital letters (maximum three).
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00012000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> The first line contains the description of the user's current location
    and the type of store you want, the coordinates and the type being separated by a
    space (for example, <tt> 100 -160 SM </tt>). In the second line, there is the number
    of existing locations (there will never be more than 200). One line follows for each
    location with the respective data: point coordinates (integers) and type of
    separated by a space (for example, <tt> 140 120 R </tt>, which indicates
    a restaurant). The type is always a sequence of capital letters (not
    more than three). There may be stores other than those indicated in the
    example. The coordinates belong to the range [-300,300].
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00013000000000000000"> Output </a>
    </h2> A line with the coordinates of the requested place, followed by the indication of the
    type and an integer that is the <em> square of the distance </em> that it is (for
    example, <tt> 220 -140 SM 14800 </tt>). <b> It will therefore not be necessary (nor
    should) calculate square roots </b>. As mentioned, if there are two or
    more locations at the same distance, will respond whichever comes first
    in the data. If there is no store of the desired type you should print
    <tt> None </tt> (note the capital letter in the first letter).
