      The proverb "soft water on hard stone, it beats until it sticks" does not want
      say someone is going to explode if they're continually under pressure, but
      yes, with persistence, difficulties can be overcome. It is natural that
      the effort required is greater in some cases than in others.

    <p>
      Write a program that analyzes a sequence of \ (0 \) 's and \ (1 \)' s and
      counts how many times it was possible to overcome the difficulty level,
      considering various scenarios. A sequence of adjacent \ (1 \) 's
      represents a sequence of consecutive attempts and it is considered that if
      exceeded the level of difficulty of the scenario if the maximum number of
      \ (1 \) 's in a row exceed your difficulty level.

    There follows a line with a positive integer \ (n \) representing the

    positive indicating the level of difficulty of the corresponding scenario. THE
    sequence of \ (0 \) 's and \ (1 \)' s can be very large and \ (n \) too.
