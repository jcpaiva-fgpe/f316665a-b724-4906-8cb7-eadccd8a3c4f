      Judging by the mystery movies and series, the best to send
      encrypted messages is to have a good codebook. In fact any
      book will do. If the sender and receiver have previously agreed on a
      book, they can only transmit the page number, the order number of the
      line on the page from the top, and the word order number on the
      line. These guys who write fiction are really smart ...

      Our friend Zé, a native of Avintes, thought about it all while
      he tasted a piece of the famous bread from his region. He suddenly had a
      idea. Why not use a dictionary as a codebook? Just send
      one number per word, that of the word order in the dictionary. Employee
      public in daytime and secret agent in his spare time, our friend
      Zé was thrilled. So he was able to send secret messages over the
      IRS statements!

    </h2> Create a program that encodes and decodes messages from a
    dictionary. The program starts by reading a dictionary and then reads a
    sequence of messages to be encoded or decoded. In the process of
    encoding each word is converted to its order number in the dictionary,
    the first word being associated with the number 1. The process of
    decoding is the reverse, each number is converted into the word of the
    dictionary in the corresponding order.

    </h2> The starting line contains an integer \ (n \), with \ (1 \ leq n \ leq 1000 \), the
    number of words in the dictionary, followed by \ (n \) lines containing the
    words in the dictionary. The following lines contain the actions to be performed.
    These lines begin with an integer \ (a \), with \ (0 \ leq to \ leq
    2 \), with the following meaning:
    <div style = "margin-left: 2em">
      <b> 0 </b> - end of messages; <br>
      <b> 1 </b> - line with message to be coded; <br>
      <b> 2 </b> - line with message to be decoded.
    </div> In the case of messages to be encrypted or decrypted, the next whole value
    \ (c \) indicates the number of words in the message. If \ (a \) is \ (1 \), that is
    encrypt the message, the rest of the line consists of \ (c \) words, with
    \ (2 \ leq c \ leq 100 \). If \ (a \) is \ (2 \), that is, to decipher the message, the
    rest of the line consists of \ (c \) integers. At most there will be 100
    messages to be transmitted. Each word is no longer than 20 characters.
