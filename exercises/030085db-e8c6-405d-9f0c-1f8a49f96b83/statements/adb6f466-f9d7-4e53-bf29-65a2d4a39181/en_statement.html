      The <i> Rob√¥s Ricochete, Lda. </i> factory produces autonomous robots for
      cleaning of large surfaces in post-work hours. The robots
      move on a grid in the plane executing sequences of the
      following instructions:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <strong> F </strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        move forward until you encounter an obstacle;
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <strong> D </strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        rotate on itself <img width = "29" height = "15" align = "bottom" border =
        "0" src = "img1.gif" alt = "$ 90 ^ \ circ $"> to the right;
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <strong> AND </strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        rotate on itself <img width = "29" height = "15" align = "bottom" border =
        "0" src = "img1.gif" alt = "$ 90 ^ \ circ $"> to the left.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      The figure illustrates a robot's path on a 9 x 6 grid, starting at the
      bottom left corner and executing the sequence "F, D, F, E, F, D, F, D,
      F, D, F ".
    </p>
    <p>
      It is intended to determine the total distance traveled by the robot (number of
      visited cells); the size of the grid, the position of the
      obstacles and sequence of instructions. To simplify the statement,
      it is assumed that each obstacle occupies exactly one cell of the grid;
      it is also assumed that the robot is initially in the lower corner
      left (coordinates (0,0)) facing upwards (i.e. in the direction of the
      vector (0.1)).
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00051000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Write a program to determine the total distance traveled by the
    robot.
    <p>
      The problem data is entered in the following order, a value per
      each row: the number of columns and the number of rows in the grid followed by the
      number of obstacles and the coordinates of each obstacle (column, row);
      finally, the sequence of instructions from the robot (using characters
      <tt> F </tt>, <tt> D </tt>, <tt> E </tt>). You can assume that the grid has
      maximum dimension 30 x 30 and that the robot program has a maximum of 50
      instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output is an integer that represents the total distance traveled by the
      robot.
