      A company has a robotic warehouse: 2 robots place and remove the
      goods off the shelves without any human intervention. The warehouse is
      rectangular and each of the robots is assigned to one side. The game
      robots would never meet but, due to a design error, they can
      find yourself at a single point. At the center of the warehouse is the gas station
      battery charging that is common to both robots. The robots
      take the opportunity to go to this place when their batteries are low and
      close enough to the center of the warehouse. When they decide to load
      batteries simultaneously collide and human intervention is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The robots are controlled by instructions that assume that the
      warehouse is a regular grid of 30 by 15 cells, with the point of
      supply in the coordinates (0,0). A sequence of instructions is
      executed without cycles or jumps, indicating only the movements of the robot.
      The commands are just the integers 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8, representing
      the directions, as on the numeric keypad: 2 points south, 8 points
      North, 4 to the West and 6 to the East; 5 means staying in the same
      place (this command can be executed at any time). The sequence
      instructions is preceded by the location of the robot and terminated by 0. The
      robots are synchronized and every second execute a command, starting
      at exactly the same time. It is known that during the execution of the instructions
      the robot goes <em> at most only once </em> to the charging station of the
      batteries and stays there for a few seconds (executing command 5).

    </h2> It will be necessary to write a program that analyzes the sequences of
    commands from both robots and check for collisions; that is,
    whether the time intervals that the robots would be refueling were
    overlap. The program receives two sequences of instructions that have
    exactly the same length and already guarantee that the robots move in the
    warehouse interior. Each of them preceded by the robot's initial position and
    terminated by 0. If they lead to the collision of the robots, then the
    verification writes <code> KO </code>. If there is no danger of collision,
    write <code> OK </code>.
