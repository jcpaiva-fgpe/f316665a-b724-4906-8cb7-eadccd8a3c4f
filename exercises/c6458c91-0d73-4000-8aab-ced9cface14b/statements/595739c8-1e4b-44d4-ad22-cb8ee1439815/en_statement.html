      <em> "Two suspects, A and B, are arrested by the police. The police have evidence
      insufficient to convict them, but, separating the prisoners, offers the
      both the same agreement: if one of the prisoners, confessing, testifies
      against the other and that other remains silent, what he confessed comes out
      free while the silent accomplice serves 10 years of sentence. If both
      remain silent, the police can only sentence them to 6 months in jail
      each one. If they both betray the partner, they each go to jail for 5 years. Each
      prisoner makes his decision without knowing what decision the other is going to make, and
      neither is sure of the other's decision. The question that the dilemma poses is:
      what will happen? How will the prisoner react? "</em>

    <p>
      This is the original formulation of the "Prisoner's Dilemma" made in 1950, and
      since then used in Game Theory to model such trivial situations,
      like what two people who accidentally exchange their bags do, or
      as complex, as the system that became known during the Cold War
      by Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD).
    </p>
    <p>
      In Game Theory, the basic models are particularly interesting
      that allow repeated games, with memory of previous moves.
      Imagine a card game: the rules of a play can be repeated
      by several hands; the (good) players remember the cards played
      previously; and at the end the winnings for each hand are added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prisoner's Dilemma is also a basic game that can be played at any time.
      iterated form. In each iteration the player's points are given by a
      earnings matrix. In the classic example presented above the matrix of
      gains would be as follows (taking prison months as losses):

      The iterated version of the Prisoner's Dilemma models many situations of
      cooperation and confrontation, from the explanations for the relations
      living beings based on the Darwinian theory of evolution, the theories
      economic conditions for relations between companies.

    </h2>
    <p>
      It is intended to write a program to calculate the points of each player
      Prisoner's Dilemma iterated and determine the winner. How input is
      given the winning matrix followed by a sequence of <em> n </em> moves. THE
      matrix is ​​given by lines of 2 values, respectively the gains of the
      players A and B, for the following cases: A and B cooperate; Cooperate and B
      deserted; Deserted and B cooperates; A and B defect. A line follows with the
      <em> n </em> number of moves and <em> n </em> lines with a pair of values ​​0
      or 1 (0 defect and 1 cooperate) respectively for players A
      or B.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program will indicate the number of points accumulated by each of the
      players. Each line will have the name of a player (A or B) followed by a space
      and the respective score, with the players being presented in order
      decreasing score. If players tie then there will be only one
      line with reference AB followed by a space and the value of the
      both.
