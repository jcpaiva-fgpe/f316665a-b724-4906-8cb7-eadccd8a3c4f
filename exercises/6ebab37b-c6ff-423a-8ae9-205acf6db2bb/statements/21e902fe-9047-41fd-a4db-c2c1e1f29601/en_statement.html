    </h2> The Department of Computer Science at the Faculty of Science of the
    University of Porto is promoting a programming tournament for students
    secondary: ToPAS.
    <p>
      The final classification is obtained by the number of problems solved
      for each team. In the event of a tie, the tiebreaker criterion is used
      total time spent. The total time spent by a team is the sum of the time
      spent on each problem solved by that team. The team that wins
      solve as many problems in the shortest time as possible.

    </h2> Write a program that, given the time spent by each team at
    solve each of the problems, determine which is the first, second and
    third place in the tournament. That is, order the teams according to the
    criteria already stated and select the three best classified.
    <i> Assume that none of the three best ranked teams solves the
    same number of problems in the same total time. </i>

    </h2> The first line of the input is four integers <i> N </i> (<100),
    <i> P </i> (<100), <i> T </i> (<600) and <i> R </i> (<10000) that indicate
    respectively the number of teams participating in the tournament, the number of
    existing problems, the time in minutes of the tournament and the number of problems
    resolved by all teams. The remaining <i> R </i> lines show
    information on the problems solved. Each line is a sequence of
    three integers, representing the number of the team, the number of the problem
    resolved and the time spent in minutes solving that problem. <br>

    </h2> The output is three lines that present information respectively
    relative to first, second and third place in the tournament. Each
    line is a sequence of three integers, representing the number of the team, the
    number of problems solved and the total time spent.
