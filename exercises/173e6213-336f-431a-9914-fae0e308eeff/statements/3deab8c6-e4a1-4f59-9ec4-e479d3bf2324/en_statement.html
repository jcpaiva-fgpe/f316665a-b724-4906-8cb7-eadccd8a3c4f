      We all know how old we are but we rarely take the trouble to
      know how many days we have exactly. And this is important because for years
      that not only seem to cost more to spend but actually have even more
      days, like leap years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, there is the concept of Julian date, or Julian day, which counts the
      number of days in a row from an arbitrary date. The Julian date is
      used mainly to reference astronomical observations, but it simplifies
      also calculating the number of days between dates. For example, for
      calculate the number of days passed from our birth to today
      just subtract the respective Julian dates.

    </h2> Calculate the Julian date for dates in our era. Year, month are given
    and day as integers (January = 1). The Julian date is calculated using the
    following algorithm. If the month is before March (month 3) then
    <div style = "margin-left: 2em">
      year: = year - 1 <br>
      month: = month + 12
    </div> From these values, it is calculated
    <div style = "margin-left: 2em">
      A: = year / 100 (entire division) <br>
      B: = A / 4 (entire division)
    </div> If the date is later than 10/15/1582, when the Calendar started
    Gregorian that we currently use, so
    <div style = "margin-left: 2em">
      C: = 2 - A + B
    </div> In the Gregorian calendar, leap years were introduced for
    compensate for the fact that a year does not have an entire number of days, avoiding the
    progressive mismatch between the calendar and astronomical observations. If
    is a date equal to or before 10/4/1582, the end of the Julian calendar,
    then
    <div style = "margin-left: 2em">
      C: = 0
    </div> In the Julian calendar, previously in force, the years had always
    365 days. It should be noted that in Portugal on 4/10/1582 the day
    10/15/1582, to readjust the calendar. From these values ​​it is calculated
    <div style = "margin-left: 2em">
      D: = whole part of [365.25 x (year + 4716)] <br>
      E: = whole part of [30,6001 x (month + 1)]
    </div> with the Julian date (DJ) being given by
