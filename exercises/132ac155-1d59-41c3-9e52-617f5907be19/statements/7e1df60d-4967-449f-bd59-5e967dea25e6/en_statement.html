      In the Andromeda galaxy there is a quantum programming tournament
      interplanetary (TOPQUI) very popular, similar to ToPAS. In this
      immense teams of extraterrestrials participate and the team
      winner wins the set of prizes awarded by the planets that
      organize the contest. There is something unclear about the distribution rule for
      prizes: (1) it is the team leader who distributes the prizes,
      grouping the prizes into lots and delivering a lot to each member of the
      team; (2) there are prizes of different values; (3) the difference between the
      number of prizes in each lot must not exceed 1 and (4) the head of the
      team cannot keep more prizes than any other member of the
      team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, also in Andromeda, there is a popular saying that `` whoever leaves and
      share and don't get the best part, either you are foolish or you have no art. ''
      Therefore, at TOPQUI, the head of the winning team will always try to
      distribute the prizes in order to keep the most valuable lot that is
      possible.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00051000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Write a program to help the winning team leader
    choose the most valuable prize lot possible, calculating the
    value of that lot.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00052000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two
    whole numbers that represent, respectively, the number of
    extraterrestrials from the winning team and the number of prizes. The second line
    contains a sequence of integers, each representing the value of
    one of the prizes. The contest rules ensure that there are always at least
    as many prizes as there are members of the winning team and that there are no more than
    1000 prizes.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00053000000000000000"> Output </a>
    </h2> The output is a line with only an integer that represents the
    value of the prize lot that the team leader will reserve for you.
