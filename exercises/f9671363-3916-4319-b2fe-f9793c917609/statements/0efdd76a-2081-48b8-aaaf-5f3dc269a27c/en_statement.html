      The top head of an organized crime network is trapped in a chain of
      maximum security, in complete isolation, for 6 months. Even though
      he has managed to continue to manage the part of his organization that has not yet
      is behind bars because his associates sent him a
      mobile phone.

      "cellphone.png" alt = "Image cellphone">
    </div> In reality, we realized this intention in time, but we chose
    for not preventing the cell phone from reaching you. We hoped to get from
    cell phone conversations information that would allow us to do other
    arrests and put him in a cell with ultra sensitive microphones. At the
    However, the prisoner communicates only by SMS and to telephone numbers on the
    foreign. To make the situation more difficult, messages are encrypted
    automatically by the phone itself and we are unable to decipher them.
    <p>
      Fortunately the microphones installed in the cell are sensitive enough
      to distinguish the tones of each key pressed. For
      we can quickly decipher the messages that the prisoner sends,
      we need a program that converts sequences of the same key in the
      associated letter. For example, three consecutive rings from the
      "8" key corresponds to the letter "V". Two more presses of the "3" key,
      followed by two touches on the "6" key, followed by two touches on the key
      "6", followed by a touch of the "3" key, followed by two touches of the key
      "3", form the word "SELL".
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the last two letters of the word "SELL" ("D" and "E") are
      achieved by sequences of the same key ("3"). If there is a certain
      delay between pressing two keys on mobile phones assumes that the
      sequence ended and a new one started.

      Some keys can be repeated up to three times, two of them can be
      repeated four times and twice only once. To facilitate the
      legibility the "1" key is associated with the "_" character (`` underscore '')
      and not to the space character. You can assume that the keys are not repeated
      more times than the values ​​defined in the table. That is, you can assume
      that the "2" key is never pressed four times nor the "1" key twice or
      more times.

      In addition to the numerical values ​​corresponding to the digits, also used
      two special numeric values:

    <ul>
      <li> 77 - represents a wait that allows us to consider the end of a
      sequence;
      </li>
      <li> 99 - represents the end of the message.
      </li>
    </ul>
