    </h2>
    <p>
      The inhabitants of the kingdom of Stubbornness are almost fixed in ideas, preferring
      stand up than sit in chairs for which they do not nurture special
      empathy. Only very exhausted are they seated in some who, not being one of their
      predilect, also do not totally reject. In society they respect a
      strict hierarchy, waiting for their superiors to feel or
      insist on standing up, to move on to a place of your own
      preferably still unoccupied.

      <a name="SECTION00072000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that, given the number of existing chairs in each
      type and given the inhabitants' preferences, in decreasing order of
      preference determines the number of those standing and the number of
      chairs that remain unoccupied. The inhabitants are exhausted.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00073000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> The first row has the number of types of chairs. The following are
    even data <img width = "32" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src =
    "img13.gif" alt = "$ \ mathtt {t \; \; v} $">, where <img width = "14" height = "15"
    align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img14.gif" alt = "$ \ mathtt t $"> is a type and
    <img width = "14" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img15.gif" alt =
    "$ \ mathtt v $"> the number of chairs that exist of type <img width = "14"
    height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img14.gif" alt = "$ \ mathtt t $">.
    If there are no chairs of a given type <img width = "14" height = "15" align =
    "bottom" border = "0" src = "img14.gif" alt = "$ \ mathtt t $">, the data will have
    <img width = "32" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img16.gif" alt =
    "$ \ mathtt {t \; \; 0} $">. Note that <img width = "14" height = "15" align = "bottom"
    border = "0" src = "img14.gif" alt = "$ \ mathtt t $"> e <img width = "14" height = "15"
    align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img15.gif" alt = "$ \ mathtt v $"> are in
    consecutive lines.
    <p>
      After the information about the chairs, find the number of inhabitants
      of the kingdom and then the preferences of each, being already indicated
      <b> according to the hierarchy of the kingdom </b>. Each inhabitant is given the number
      of options (which can be <img width = "14" height = "15" align = "bottom"
      border = "0" src = "img17.gif" alt = "$ \ mathtt 0 $">) and then the types of
      chairs in which you agree to sit, in descending order of preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      There can be up to 100 types of chairs and up to 1000 of each type. Neither
      number of inhabitants of the kingdom nor the total number of seats exceeds
      60000.
