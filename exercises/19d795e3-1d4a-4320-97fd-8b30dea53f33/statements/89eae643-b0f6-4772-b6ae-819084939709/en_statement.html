      How easy it is to distribute virtual candies! Just calculate the quotient and
      the rest of an entire division to find out how many candies you can give and
      how many are left. The biggest problem is sometimes remembering the multiplication table.

      <a name="SECTION00011000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Write a program to help analyze various scenarios,
    presenting the distribution result in each case.
    <p>
      In the first line of data you have the number of scenarios to consider.
      An equal number of lines follows, each containing two integers
      positive (number of sweets to be distributed and number of people) and two
      characters (<code> Q </code> and <code> R </code> or <code> R </code> and
      <code> Q </code>), separated by a space.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each scenario, the program writes a line. If in the scenario you have
      <code> Q </code> followed by <code> R </code>, you will first have the quotient and
      then the rest, and if it's <code> R </code> and then <code> Q </code>, you'll have
      first the rest and then the quotient. In any case, you will always have to
      identify each value, preceding it by <code> Q </code> or <code> R </code>
      followed by a colon and a space.
