      ComputerWave decided to implement a new system for the management
      of your computer stock, asking the computer engineer
      Bernardo to deal with the matter. Bernardo, who is an engineer
      innovative, implemented an indicator, which he called the indicator
      more-or-less, which calculates, on a monthly basis, the number of computers
      should be in stock. The indicator is based on sales for the last three
      months and sales of the same month in the previous two years. The calculation of
      indicator is no more than the average between these two values: the average of
      sales in the last three months and the average sales for the same month in the two
      previous years. These averages must be truncated, that is, they must be
      rounded to the largest integer less than or equal to the exact value.
      To build the indicator for the current month, Bernardo draws from the base
      of sales data the sales figures in the last 24 months.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00011000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Write a program to help engineer Bernardo calculate the
    plus-or-minus indicator.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00012000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> The input consists of a sequence of 24 lines. In each line there are
    two numbers: the date and the value of sales. The date appears in the format
    AAAAMM, for example 201401. The input is in chronological order and there is no
    months of the same year, repeated. We also know that the number of sales in
    each month does not exceed 1000.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00013000000000000000"> Output </a>
    </h2> A line with just an integer that represents the number of
    computers that need to be in stock next month, this is the value
    of the plus-or-minus indicator.
