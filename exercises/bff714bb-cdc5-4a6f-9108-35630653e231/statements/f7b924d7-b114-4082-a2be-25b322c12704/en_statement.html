      At the Senhor Moeda store, notes are not accepted to pay for purchases
      made by customers, nor change in notes. Everything is done with
      2 and 1 euro coins and 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 coins
      cents. In the store there is an unlimited stock of coins and, by the way,
      items for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to keep customers happy, whenever Mr. Moeda gives
      change, gives as few coins as possible.

      Write a program that, given the purchase price and the currencies that the customer
      delivered to pay for the purchase, it indicates the coins given in change, if it is
      possible to make the purchase (that is, when the value delivered by the customer
      is greater than or equal to the purchase price). Otherwise, the purchase will not
      can be done and the coins delivered by the customer are
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if the amount to be paid is 5 euros and 25 cents and the customer
      deliver a 2-euro coin, three 1-euro coins and two 50-euro coins
      cents, the change will be made up of a 50 cent coin, a currency
      20 cents and a 5 cent coin.

      There are always 2 lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first line has two integers, \ (E \) and \ (C \), which
      indicate that the purchase price is \ (E \) euros and \ (C \) cents. Fur
      least one of these numbers is positive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second line has 8 non-negative integers, \ (n_1, n_2, \ ldots,
      n_8 \), which indicate the number of coins of each type delivered by the customer
      to make the payment. These figures are given for the currency with the highest
      value to the lowest value currency. Thus, \ (n_1 \) is the number of coins of 2
      euros delivered by the customer and \ (n_8 \) is the number of coins of 1
      cent delivered by the customer.

      A single line with 8 non-negative integers, which indicate the number of
      coins of each type that will be given to the customer. If the amount delivered
      by the customer is greater than or equal to the purchase price, these coins are
      the change given by Mr. Moeda. Otherwise, these coins were the
      delivered by the customer to Mr. Currency. As at the entrance, the first
      number corresponds to the 2 euro coin, the second number corresponds to the
      1 euro coin, and so on, respecting the decreasing order
      of the face value of the coins.
