      Problem
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two friends meet for a magic card tournament. Each has
      a deck of cards with monsters, each card containing an integer
      which indicates the character's combat strength. Each player stacks
      `` strategically '' <img width = "15" height = "15" align = "bottom" border =
      "0" src = "img23.gif" alt = "$ n $"> letters (equal number for both
      players). The development of a game occurs in a sequence of
      fights as follows. Player A and Player B draw the card.
      top of your deck.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> If player A's card is more powerful than player B's,
      then player A wins that match, and player B's card is for the
      player A. Both cards are placed at the bottom of player A's deck,
      with player B's card under player A's card.
      </li>
      <li> If player B's card has more attack power than player B's card
      player A, then B wins that match. In this case, it is player B who remains
      with player A's card. Place your card on the base of your deck first
      letter and then A.
      </li>
      <li> If both cards have the same attack power then a
      a tie. In this case, each player places his card on the basis of his
      cheap.
      </li>
    </ul> The game proceeds in a similar way. The particularity and interest
    of the game comes from the fact that the cards are magic. In such a way that when
    two cards meet, regardless of the outcome of the fight, the
    card power is decremented by one (because the monster gets tired of the
    fights and loses energy). If the value of the card reaches 0 it is withdrawn from
    game. This rule introduces interest in the game, because otherwise the player
    with the highest card I could never lose the game.
    <p>
      The player who loses all cards during a sequence of matches
      loses the game. To avoid very long games, if after <img width =
      "54" height = "38" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img24.gif" alt = "$ n ^ 3 + n $">
      neither player has won, the game is considered to be
      tied. If both players run out of cards simultaneously the game
      is also tied.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Assignment
    </h2> Implement a program that, given the players' decks, simulates the
    game to determine which of the two players wins.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Input
    </h2> In the first line is the number <img width = "15" height = "15" align =
    "bottom" border = "0" src = "img23.gif" alt = "$ n $"> of cards they will play with
    (<img width = "87" height = "31" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img25.gif" alt =
    "$ 1 \ leq n \ leq 20 $">). In the following lines there is a description of the <img width =
    "15" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img23.gif" alt = "$ n $">
    cards from player A's deck (ie <img width = "15" height = "15" align =
    "bottom" border = "0" src = "img23.gif" alt = "$ n $"> integers that represent the
    power of the chosen cards, from top to bottom). Nas <img width = "15"
    height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img23.gif" alt = "$ n $"> remaining,
    has the description of <img width = "15" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0"
    src = "img23.gif" alt = "$ n $"> cards from player B.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Output
    </h2> The program must write <tt> A </tt>, <tt> B </tt> or <tt> E </tt>, to
    indicate the player who wins the game, followed by a line change. Will write
    <tt> And </tt> if there was a tie.
