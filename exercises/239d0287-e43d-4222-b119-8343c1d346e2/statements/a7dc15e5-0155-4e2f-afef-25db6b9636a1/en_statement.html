      The crew of AirGlobe's planes receives a bonus whenever
      crosses the Greenwich meridian or the equator. The bonus can be
      converted into rest days and is expressed in points, attributed from the
      as follows: 1 point if the flight crosses the Greenwich meridian; two
      points if the flight crosses the equator; 4 points if the flight crosses the
      Greenwich meridian and the equator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Commander Passarinho wants to go to Rock in Rio de Lisboa and needs
      to know if he already has the necessary points to be able to rest on those days. O
      Greenwich semimeridian, used as a reference for determining the
      longitude, is sometimes referred to as the `` Greenwich Meridian '', being
      normally represented on geographic maps (0 degree mark)
      longitude). However, Commander Passarinho also knows that the meridian
      Greenwich is a maximum circle that passes through the poles and divides the
      Earth in two hemispheres: the eastern hemisphere and the hemisphere
      western. He will not go around the world to earn more points, but he wants
      points you are entitled to, because meridian is meridian, it is not
      semimeridian!

    </h2>
    <p>
      For the purpose of calculating the bonus, each flight is described by the coordinates
      geographical areas (latitude and longitude) of the departure airport and the airport
      arrival. Latitude, which measures the distance to the equator, is expressed in
      degrees and ranges from 0 to 90 degrees, north or south. The longitude,
      which measures the distance to the `` Greenwich meridian '', is also expressed in
      degrees and varies between 0 and 180 degrees, east or west.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this information available for each of the flights flown by the
      Commander Passarinho, it will be easy to calculate how many points he has.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data for the program is entered as follows: first,
      the number of flights of Commander Passarinho. Then there are so many lines
      how many the number of flights. In each line there are eight elements of
      information, in two groups of four. The first group describes the
      coordinates of the airport of departure and the second group describes the
      coordinates of the airport of arrival. In each of the groups, first comes
      an integer, with a value between 0 and 90 exclusive, then a letter
      capitalized <tt> N </tt> or <tt> S </tt>, then a number between 0 and
      180 exclusive and then a capital letter <tt> E </tt> or <tt> W </tt>.
      In this description, the first pair of values, number and letter, represents the
      airport latitude, with <tt> N </tt> meaning northern hemisphere and
      <tt> S </tt> the southern hemisphere; the second pair represents the longitude of the
      airport, with <tt> E </tt> meaning that the airport is in the hemisphere
      eastern and <tt> W </tt> in the western.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program will write a line, with an integer representing the
      number of points of Commander Passarinho.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that there is no airport located on the Greenwich meridian
      nor about the equator.
