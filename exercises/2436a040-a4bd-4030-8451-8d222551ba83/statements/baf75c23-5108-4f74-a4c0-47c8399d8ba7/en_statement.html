      There was no Game Boy, PlayStation, New Nintendo 3DS, Wii, PADs,
      Smartphones, nothing, nothing ... paper and pencil was enough to give free rein to
      imagination and ensure a few hours of entertainment. We don't talk about
      Jurassic period. According to some records, the game Batalha Naval appears in
      World War I (1914-1918). It is, therefore, a game of bad memory but,
      however, centenary.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Naval Battle two players participate, each one with its fleet and the
      objective is to sink the opponent's fleet by guessing the position of the ships
      enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each player arranges his fleet in a grid and also maintains another one
      grid that represents the disposition of the opponent's fleet (according to what
      discovering it during the game). In positioning the fleet, you can
      choose any orientation for each ship, vertically or horizontally,
      provided that the ships do not touch each other at any point.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several versions of the game, which differ in the size of the grid,
      constitution of the fleet or in the rules of the game. Let's assume that the grid is
      \ (10 ​​\ times 10 \). In each game, the constitution of the fleet is the same for both
      the players, but we admit some flexibility in the type and number of
      ships to use. Possible types are: aircraft carriers (<b> P </b>),
      battleships (<b> E </b>), seaplanes (<b> H </b>),
      cruisers (<b> C </b>) and submarines (<b> S </b>). The figure shows
      their shapes. Players will decide how many to use of each type. How much
      to the rules, we assume that, each player fires three shots in each move and
      then it passes the turn to the opponent, unless his move is invalid.
      In response, the opponent tells you if the three shots hit the water
      or the number of shots that hit each type of ship hit (without saying
      how many ships it reached of each type).

    </h2> As paper-and-pencil and face-to-face games seem to be out of fashion,
    let's create a simple program to support the Naval Battle
    <em> online </em>. The program receives the disposal of each player's fleet and
    a sequence of moves and gives the <em> feedback </em> that the opponent would give to
    every move. The sequence ends if one of the players wins the game but can
    also finish at any stage of the game. The program must identify the
    chosen fleet.

    </h2> It starts with 10 lines, with 20 integers separated by spaces, which are
    <tt> 0 </tt> (water) or <tt> 1 </tt> (ship). The left part defines the
    positioning of player 1's fleet and the right defines the positioning of the
    player 2's fleet. Next there is a line with an integer
    positive \ (m \) representing the total number of moves. Then there's
    \ (m \) lines, each with three pairs of positive integers. Each pair
    corresponds to a shot and identifies the row and column of the position to be hit
    (rows and columns are numbered from 1, from top to bottom and from
    left to right). Always start <em> player 1 </em>.
    If any of the shots in a move refer to a position previously
    hit by the player (ship or water), this move is considered totally
    invalid and, on the next line, there will be a play by the same player.
    <p> </p>

    </h2> For each move, there is a line with the format "<code> Player k:
    Water </code> "," <code> Player k: Invalid </code> "," <code> Player k:
    seq </code> ", where <code> k </code> will be replaced by the identifier of the
    player and <code> seq </code> for information on the number of shots that
    hit each type of ship hit. Quotation marks are not included or
    accents. The sequence <code> seq </code> is a sequence of pairs \ (Tt \), with
    a space between each pair but not between \ (T \) and \ (t \), with \ (T \) being the
    identifier of a type of ship and \ (t \) the number of shots that hit
    ships of that type in this move (\ (t = 1,2,3 \)). The string should be
    ordered by type of ship (in the order <code> P </code>,
    <code> E </code>, <code> H </code>, <code> C </code>, <code> S </code>).
    <p>
      If any of the players win the game, due to the destruction of the
      opponent, the output will have one more line with "<code> Won the player
      k </code> ", with <code> k </code> being the winner's identifier.
