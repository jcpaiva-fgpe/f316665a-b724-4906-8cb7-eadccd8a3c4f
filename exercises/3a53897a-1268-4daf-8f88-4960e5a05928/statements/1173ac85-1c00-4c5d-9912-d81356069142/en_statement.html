      The volcanic ash cloud from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which
      erupted on April 14, caused chaos in European airspace
      and forced the cancellation of more than one hundred thousand flights. Conditions
      favorable weather conditions allowed it to spread initially to
      southeast, at about 40 km / h. The forecast of its trajectory and dispersion was
      difficult because it depended on the evolution of the volcano's activity and the
      different wind patterns at various altitudes.

    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00071000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> The intention is to follow the trajectory of the cloud, starting from a position
    initial analysis, and to analyze how it affects certain European locations. The model was
    very simplified: the planisphere is described by a rectangular grid;
    each cell in the grid is a 2-sided square and is defined by the
    coordinates of its lower left corner, which belong to the range
    [-100000, 100000]; the cloud is a rectangle fitted to the grid, occupies one or
    more cells, and it is invariable (does not disperse).
    <p>
      It is assumed that the cloud always moves at the same altitude, and with speed
      constant in each unit interval. You can only move in the following
      directions / directions: <tt> N (0.1) </tt>, <tt> S (0, -1) </tt>, <tt> E
      (1.0) </tt>, <tt> O (-1,0) </tt>, <tt> SE (1, -1) </tt>, <tt> SO (-1, -1 ) </tt>,
      <tt> NO (-1,1) </tt> or <tt> NE (1,1) </tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a point on the cloud is at the position (X, Y) at a given time T and the
      cloud to move with speed (H, V) in the interval [T, T + 1 [, that point
      will be in position (X + H, Y + V) at time T + 1. During that interval of
      time, the cloud can pass through several locations, saying that they have been
      under the influence of the cloud in that period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sites are located in the center of the cells that contain them and are: <tt> Athens
      (12779, 20557) </tt>, <tt> Barcelona (1113, 22779) </tt>, <tt> Frankfurt
      (4445, 22779) </tt>, <tt> Funchal (-8887, 17779) </tt>, <tt> Lisbon (-4999,
      21113) </tt>, <tt> London (1, 28335) </tt>, <tt> Madrid (-1665, 22223) </tt>,
      <tt> Paris (1113, 26667) </tt>, <tt> Porto (-4443, 22779) </tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total allocation level for each location will be given by the number of
      periods when the location had some point in the cloud over it. On each
      unitary interval, the level of affectation of the affected sites grows
      just one unit.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00072000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> In the first line there are four integers, A, B, C and D, separated by a
    space: (A, B) and (C, D) are the initial positions of the lower vertices
    left and top right of the cloud. In the next line you have the number of
    intervals to consider (maximum 300) and then, on each line, a pair of
    <em> even integers </em> H and V which gives the speed of the cloud in each
    these unit intervals. You can assume that the coordinates of the cloud are
    keeps in the range [-40000, 40000] during the simulation.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00073000000000000000"> Output </a>
    </h2> In the first line you have the number of affected sites. If that number
    is zero, on the next line is "<tt> Did you go to the North Pole? </tt>", without
    quotes or accents. If it is different from zero, in the following lines it has the
    alphabetical list of affected locations and levels of allocation
    corresponding names (the name will be separated from the value by a space).
