      - Mario, I can guess numbers by telepathy. - said Marta. -
      Think of a number and don't tell me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mário nodded, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      - I've thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      - If the number you thought is even, multiply it by five; otherwise, it multiplies
      for seven - continued Marta. - Now, add up to five; multiply by
      two; adds up to 10; divide by two, is it already? Add five again and
      multiplies by three. You haven't gotten lost yet, have you? Well, if the number in
      that you had thought was unique, now add the quadruple of that number. Already
      it’s almost there, you just need to divide it by five Now, I think you already thought
      enough in the number for me to guess it. How much did I give you?
    </p>
    <p>
      - Thirty three. - Mário replies, curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Aah! Ah! - exclaims Marta, victorious but tired of so many accounts of
      head - So you thought of number eight, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      - It was was. - Mário nodded, very puzzled. And he said to his
      buttons: `` Is this art or ingenuity? Telepathy or trick? ''

      A line with an integer that represents Marta's answer,
      guessing the number that Mário initially thought of. If it does not exist
      an integer that can give rise to the number that Mário obtained, the
      Marta will reply, `` I think you were wrong in the accounts. '' (Without quotes).
