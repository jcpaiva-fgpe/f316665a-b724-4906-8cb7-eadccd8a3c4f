    <p>
      The metro administration decided to replace the automatic
      ticket sales at the stations, because, being very sophisticated, the
      the truth is that they are very expensive and break down a lot. The new machines are more
      cheaper and more robust, but unfortunately they are more basic: they require that
      buyer enter the exact amount (they do not give change, therefore) and in addition
      In addition, they do not accept more than four coins at a time, in the same purchase.
      For example, if the ticket price was € 1.30, the buyer could
      introduce a one euro coin and a 20 cent coin and a 10 cent coin
      cents, or one for one euro and three for 10 cents, but the machine
      would refuse if payment was made with one euro coin, two of 10
      cents and two of 5 cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, travel prices have to be chosen in such a way that
      can be paid with four coins. For example, there can be no trips
      costing € 3.35, as we would need at least five coins to
      pay that amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, at the time of increasing the ticket price, the new price has to
      be chosen in such a way that it can be paid with four coins, when
      much. The administration does not want to lose money and, therefore, if the new
      value thought by the administration is not acceptable by the machines, this
      value will have to be increased, as little as possible, in order to
      an acceptable value is reached. Returning to the example above, if the
      management initially wanted the new price to be € 3.35, it would have
      increase it to € 3.40, which can now be paid in four currencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is, given the price the administration wants and the values ​​of the
      currencies that the machine accepts, calculate the lowest price greater than or equal to the
      target price that can be paid with four of these currencies. Note that
      machine is configured so as not to accept all currencies in
      circulation (for example, you may not accept coins of one cent or two
      cents, or two euros). Furthermore, it is not impossible for other
      coins will come into circulation soon (for example, 3 cent coins
      or 25 cents, as there are in some countries). That’s why it’s necessary
      also indicate the currency values ​​that the machine is prepared for
      accept.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00061000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Write a program to calculate the ticket price, given the value that
      administration intends and the currency values ​​that the machine accepts. O
      price must be the lowest value greater than or equal to the price intended by the
      administration that can be formed using a maximum of four currencies from those
      the machine accepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data for the program is entered in the following order: first,
      the price intended by the administration, in cents; then on the line
      next, a number, indicating how many types of coins the machine accepts;
      finally, on the next line, a list of numbers, with so many numbers
      how many types of currencies, with the value corresponding to each one of these
      types of currencies, expressed in cents, in ascending order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program will write the calculated price for the ticket, in the form of a
      whole number of cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that the price sought by the administration is not higher than the
      quadruple the value of the highest value currency and the number of coins
      different will never be greater than 10.
