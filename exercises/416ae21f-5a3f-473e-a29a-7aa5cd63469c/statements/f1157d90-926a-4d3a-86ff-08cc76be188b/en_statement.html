      He would love to buy a new skateboard, but his mother, Marge, will only do it if
      have good grades. But he has big problems with mathematics ...
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart knows that in the next class he will be called to the board to factor out a
      number. Remember that a positive prime number is an integer
      positive greater than 1 which is only divisible by 1 and by itself.
      Factorizing a number is to break it down into a product of its prime factors.
      For example, 24 can be written as 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 (2 and 3 are prime) and 1050
      can be written as 2 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 (2, 3, 5 and 7 are prime).
    </p>
    <p>
      Bart could ask his sister Lisa for help, but he is too proud to
      that. Can you help him and show him how to factor a number?

    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Task </font>
    </h2> Write a program that, given a number, factores it, decomposing it into a
    product of prime factors.
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Input </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the first line there is an integer <b> C </b>, which indicates the number of
      cases to be treated (1≤ <b> C </b> ≤20). <br>
      Follow exactly <b> C </b> lines, each containing a unique number
      integer <b> N </b>, which represents a number that we want to factorize (2≤
      <b> N </b> <5000).
    </p>
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Output </font>
    </h2>
    <p>
      It consists of <b> C </b> lines, each containing the factorization of a
      number (in the order they appear in the <i> input </i>, in the format <tt> NUMERO =
      FACTOR1 * FACTOR2 * ... * FACTORn </tt>. See the example to get a better understanding. You
      Prime factors must always come in ascending order of magnitude (that is,
      write <tt> 24 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 </tt> and never <tt> 24 = 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 </tt>).
      Also note that there is only one and only one space before and after the symbol
      of equality.
