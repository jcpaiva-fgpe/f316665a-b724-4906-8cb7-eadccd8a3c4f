      In some cinemas, theaters and sports venues there are no
      marked places. People are choosing places of their preference and,
      sometimes, they end up "giving a little way", moving to the chair of the
      side so that a group can sit in your queue. We are interested
      observe the dynamics of a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      People arrive alone or in groups and present themselves on the left or
      on the right. For a group to feel, there must be places
      enough in the queue; if not, it will look for another queue, and it won't be much
      important for what follows. A group does not separate. The first person
      of the group occupies a place of their preference and the rest sit at their
      left if the group enters from the left, or to its right if it enters from the
      right. The place that the former intends to occupy is always free. If no
      there are places for everyone but the position immediately next to the occupied
      the first one is free, it moves in order to create places for
      the ones that are missing. If it is still not possible to seat everyone, then the
      group sits at one end (to avoid further confusion),
      occupying the innermost places. Preferably, sit in the
      extremity at which it is located, provided that this does not require the displacement of
      more people than you would need if you sat on the other end.
      In displacements, the relative positions of people seated
      previously remain, only people who are
      closer to the end where the group will be. For that, they occupy
      adjacent places that are free or that are free because other
      moving too.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one will have to travel to make room for a person who is not in
      group. There will be no queue changes.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00061000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Write a program to analyze a sequence of arrivals at a
    queue and indicate the final disposition of the groups in that queue. Groups are
    identified by the arrival order number (also count those who will have
    to look for another queue).
    <p>
      In the first line of input there is an integer (positive and less than or equal to
      50) representing the number of seats in the queue. In the following lines there is
      a sequence of <code> E N L </code> integer suits where:
      <code> AND </code> is either 0 or 1 depending on the group presented on the left or
      right, <code> N </code> (greater than or equal to 1) is the number of elements in the
      group and <code> L </code> identifies the place where the first element
      intends. The number that identifies that place refers to
      end of the group (for example, <code> 0 4 3 </code>
      means that the first element wants the third position from the
      left, while in <code> 1 4 3 </code> it would be the third from the
      right). The scenario ends with <code> 0 0 0 </code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The output is the description of the final status of the queue, seen from left to
      right, one position on each line: free positions will have a dash; at
      occupied will have the identifier of the group to which the person belongs.
