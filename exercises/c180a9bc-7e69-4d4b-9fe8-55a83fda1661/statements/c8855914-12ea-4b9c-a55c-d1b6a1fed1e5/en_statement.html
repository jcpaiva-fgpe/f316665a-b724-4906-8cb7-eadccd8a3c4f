    </h2> Write a program to count the number <tt> p </tt> and <tt> P </tt> 's
    in a sequence of letters (<tt> p </tt> and <tt> P </tt> represent plaques). THE
    sequence is given on a line, which ends with a line change and has at least
    least one letter. You can assume that it will be no longer than 1000 characters if
    useful to you. The program will write the number of plates followed by a change of
    line.
