      People from the north who intended to do beach in the Algarve and Andalusia in the
      Easter holidays, was surprised by winds, downpours and a very
      cold. <em> "Blancos llegaron y más blancos volvieron" </em>, so already
      dream of a week or fifteen days of vacation that they plan to take in
      June, July, August or September, if the holiday allowance is not in the
      flash flood. It looks like it won't ... So a group of optimistic friends is
      already trying to choose a week of vacation, according to preferences
      and unavailability of each one. This week (seven days of vacation) has to
      start on a Monday and end on the following Sunday or, in
      Alternatively, start on a Saturday and end on the following Friday. Each
      group member indicated a sequence of periods that do not overlap and
      classified each period using integers: <code> -1 </code> to mark
      unavailability and values ​​from <code> 1 </code> to <code> 5 </code> for
      express preferences, with <code> 5 </code> being the maximum level. US
      periods that it did not include, it is also available but with level of
      zero preference, if friends think it is a good idea or if there is no
      alternative. The classification serves to score similarly each day of the
      referred period. The chosen week will be one that everyone can go to,
      after 1 June (Wednesday) and ending before 12 September 2011,
      and that has the maximum score, considering the sum of the scores
      accumulated in the seven days, after processing everyone's preferences.
      If there is more than one possible week, they will choose the next one,
      don't let the cold come back in force.

    <code> 16 6 30 6 3 </code> (which would represent the period from 16 June to 30
    June with preference 3 on each day of that period; if it were
    <code> 16 6 30 6 -1 </code>, would indicate that the member could not go on that
