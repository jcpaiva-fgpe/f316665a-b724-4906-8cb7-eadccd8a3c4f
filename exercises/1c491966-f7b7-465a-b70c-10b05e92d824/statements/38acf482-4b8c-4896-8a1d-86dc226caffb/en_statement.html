      Gambozinos are described in some dictionaries as "fish or birds
      imaginary, with which, by way of a joke, they are able to achieve peace by sending them to
      hunting or fishing for these animals ", with burlap sacks so that they do not
      they escape, and perhaps with some tests to call or stun them.

    </h2>
    <p>
      A program is intended to hunt gambozinos in a rectangular region
      given, divided into unit squares. This region will always have a border
      with a unit of width, all around, and that is empty. One
      gambozino consists of a set of five unit squares
      connected by edges (that is, it is a special polynomial), being able to
      be only of the five shapes shown in the figure, on the left. None
      another way that can be obtained from these, by symmetry or rotation, is
      gambozino. The program should analyze the region and indicate how many
      gambozinos found. During the search, gambozinos do not move. THE
      region may have other species of animals, equally immobile. It is known
      that gambozinos are not very sociable: they are isolated from each other
      others share at most vertices but never edges.

    </h2> In the first line there are two integers M and N that define the dimensions of the
    region, both greater than or equal to 5 and less than 50 units.
    Following are M lines describing the content of the region, supposedly
    divided into unit squares. Each line has N integers <code> 0 </code>
    or <code> 1 </code> separated by spaces, <code> 0 </code> indicating position
    empty and <code> 1 </code> occupied position. Animals, including
    gambozinos, are formed by <code> 1 </code> 's contiguously horizontally and / or
    vertical. The edge of the region is always free as has been said, and,
    consequently, you will always have <code> 0 </code> 's as in the examples
    presented below.
