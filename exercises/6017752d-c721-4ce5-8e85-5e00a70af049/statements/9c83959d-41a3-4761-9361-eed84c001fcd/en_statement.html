      We are in crisis (that we are all tired of knowing) and to make
      even more unpleasant things, oil prices in the markets
      international markets continue to rise. Because of that, gasoline and
      diesel fuel are becoming more and more expensive. In fact, it seems that there is no week in
      that there is no increase in fuel prices. It won't be like that,
      but memory betrays us and so itâ€™s best to check.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00021000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> By consulting Galp's website, we have access to the price of gasoline,
    on each day since the beginning of the year, or, in general, since some date in the
    past. We intend, using this data, to dispel myths and calculate
    exactly the number of weeks that the price of gasoline has gone up at least
    one time.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00022000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> The first line has the number of weeks for which we have data
    about the price of gasoline. The second line has a number representing the
    price on the Sunday before the first week with complete records.
    For the purposes of this problem, we use the standard that states that the week
    starts on Monday and ends on the following Sunday. Following are so many
    lines as the number of weeks indicated in the first line, each with
    seven numbers, representing the price of gasoline on each day of the
    week. Gasoline prices are expressed by whole numbers in
    thousandths of euros. For example, the number 1759 means that the price is
    1,759 euros.
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00023000000000000000"> Output </a>
    </h2> There is only one line where only one number appears: the number of weeks
    where the price went up at least once, from one day to the next. note that
    if the price goes up from the Sunday of the previous week to the Monday of the
    current week, counts as having risen in the current week.
