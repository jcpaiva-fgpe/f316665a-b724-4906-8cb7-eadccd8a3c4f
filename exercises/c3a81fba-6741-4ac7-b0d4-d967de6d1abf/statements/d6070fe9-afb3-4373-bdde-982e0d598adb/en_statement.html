      This year the national finals of the Olympic Games are held in Abobadeira.
      Numerology, whose main event is the Game of the Rest. We will support
      with the programming of the results table and we need your
      collaboration. You still don't know the Game of Rest? It's very simple:
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <ol>
      <li> it is played with \ (N \) players, from player \ (0 \) to \ (N-1 \);
      </li>
      <li> each game has \ (M \) plays;
      </li>
      <li> in each move, each player registers an integer from \ (0 \) to
      \ (N-1 \);
      </li>
      <li> the numbers registered by all players are added, \ (S \);
      </li>
      <li> the remainder \ (R \) of the entire division of \ (S \) by \ (N \) is calculated,
        with \ (0 \ leq R \ leq N-1 \);
      </li>
      <li> the player with the number \ (R \) counts 1 more point, the
      the rest keep those who have;
      </li>
      <li> at the end of the \ (M \) moves, the winner is the one with the most points.
      </li>

      plays. Each line with a move contains \ (N \) integers \ (J_0, J_1,

      The result consists of 2 groups of lines, each line with only one
      whole. The lines in the first group have the total points for each
      player, in ascending order of the player's number. Between the first and the
      second group of lines there is a blank line. The lines of the second
      group show the numbers of the players who totaled the highest number
      of points and for that reason they won the game, also in ascending order of their
      number.
