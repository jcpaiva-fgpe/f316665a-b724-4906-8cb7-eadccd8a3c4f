      Problem
    </h2> Classical Roman civilization developed a numbering system that
    lasted for many centuries and is still used today in references
    particulars: `` D. Manuel II '', `` century. XXI '', `` year MCMXCVIII '', by
    example.
    <p>
      In Roman notation the letters I, V, X, L, C, D, M are used to represent
      quantities from 1 to 1000:

    </div> The main difference between Roman and Arabic notation (which we use
    today) is that the values ​​of the symbols are not positional, but rather
    added or subtracted according to the order in which they occur. First,
    the repeated symbols are grouped and their value added, for example:
    III is <img width = "105" height = "31" align = "middle" border = "0" src =
    "img15.gif" alt = "$ 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 $">, XX is <img width = "101" height = "31" align =
    "middle" border = "0" src = "img16.gif" alt = "$ 10 + 10 = 20 $">, MMM is <img width =
    "210" height = "31" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img17.gif" alt =
    "$ 1000 + 1000 + 1000 = 3000 $">. Next, we analyze the groups of symbols in the
    right to left:
    <ul>
      <li> The rightmost group is always <b> positive </b>.
      </li>
      <li> If a group is worth more in module than its neighbor on the right, the value
      has <b> positive </b> sign: XII is <img width = "136" height = "35" align =
      "middle" border = "0" src = "img18.gif" alt = "$ (1 + 1) + 10 = 12 $">, LVIII is
      <img width = "196" height = "35" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img19.gif"
      alt = "$ (1 + 1 + 1) + 5 + 50 = 58 $">.
      </li>
      <li> If the group is worth less in module than the neighbor on the right, its value
      has <b> negative sign </b>: IX is <img width = "111" height = "35" align =
      "middle" border = "0" src = "img20.gif" alt = "$ 10 + (- 1) = 9 $">, XXM is
      <img width = "193" height = "35" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img21.gif"
      alt = "$ 1000 + (-10-10) = $ 980">.
      </li>
      <li> No distinct symbol groups with equal values ​​can occur
      (correspond to invalid numerals like `` XVV '' or `` VIIIII '').
      </li>
    </ul> Thus, the Roman numeral MCMXCVIII is worth <img width = "421" height = "35"
    align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img22.gif" alt =
    "$ (1 + 1 + 1) + 5 + 100-10 + 1000-100 + 1000 = 1998 $">.

    <h2>
      Assignment
    </h2> Write a program that reads a Roman numeral and writes its value in
    decimal.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Input
    </h2> The input is a Roman numeral in a single line, in characters
    uppercase, less than 20 characters in length. You can assume that the
    numeral is always valid and its value does not exceed 5000.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Output
    </h2> The output must have the value of the Roman numeral in decimal (followed by
    line change).
    <p> </p>
