      The elevator company Suba-Suba opted for a new
      control of groups of elevators in order to minimize the consumption of
      energy. For a group of two elevators, identified as 1 and 2, the
      system will send the elevator that is closest to the floor from which
      the call was made. If the elevators are at the same distance
      then what is found in a higher position will be sent. If both
      elevators are on the same floor, elevator 1 will always operate.
      Elevators will not always be stopped and available to be called.
      They may be in service, under maintenance or damaged. In this case, it will send
      the only elevator available, or an error if both are unavailable.

    <p>
      It is intended to program the system that controls the call of a group two
      elevators according to the given specification. The program will receive as input the
      number of the floor on which an elevator was called, as well as the situation
      current status of each of the elevators; will indicate the elevator number best
      positioned to make the route. The input consists of three
      integers separated by a space: the number of the floor from which the
      the situation of elevator 1, followed by the situation of elevator 2. The
      floor number where the elevator was called is an integer between -100 and
      100. The position of elevators 1 and 2 may be the number of one floor,
      also a value between -100 and 100, or the number 999 to indicate that
      is unavailable. The output is 0, 1 or 2. The value 0 is reserved for the
      if both elevators are unavailable. Otherwise, it will be
      the number of the elevator best positioned to answer the call
      (1 or 2).
