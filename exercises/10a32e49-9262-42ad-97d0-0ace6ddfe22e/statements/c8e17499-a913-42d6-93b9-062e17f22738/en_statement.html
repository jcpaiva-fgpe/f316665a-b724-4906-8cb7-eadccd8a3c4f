      As the end of the championship approaches, the sick of the ball cling to the
      calculator to find out if they can already party or work on the
      rationalization. The accounts are not even difficult to do. In each of the
      missing matches are 3 points up for grabs. If the nearest opponent
      get all those points, our team none, and even then we have
      more points, so the championship is already ours. If it's the other way around, we have
      say goodbye to the championship. But it can also happen that if we lose
      points and they win either team can still win.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00011000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Given the points of our team, the closest opponent, and the number
      of missing days (there are 3 points in dispute in each of them),
      determine which case our team is in, identified by a
      <em> smiley </em>, namely:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <tt> :-D </tt> we are champions - even if we lose all the games and they
      win all, you won't be able to get more points than us; <br>
      <tt> :-) </tt> we are the biggest - we have more points than the opponent and they
      they only win if we lose too many points; <br>
      <tt>: - | </tt> there is still hope - we have less points than the opponent but
      we can still be winners; <br>
      <tt> :-( </tt> for the year it's our turn - even if we win every game
      and they lose everyone we no longer have a chance. <br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      To simplify the accounts we will assume that the team at this moment with
      more points have a much greater number of goals (unbeatable). Therefore,
      if the number of points at the end of the championship is equal, it will be the champion
      team that currently has the most points. Let's also assume that in this
      teams currently have different scores.
