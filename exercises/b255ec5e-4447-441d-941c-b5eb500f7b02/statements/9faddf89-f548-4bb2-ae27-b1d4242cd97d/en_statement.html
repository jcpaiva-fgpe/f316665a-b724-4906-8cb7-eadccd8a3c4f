      João studies Computer Science and also works in a bakery for
      help support the costs of studies. He delivers bread every
      mornings to different bakeries and pastry shops in Espinho. Pray for
      hinder your work, even when you have to go to the same places you can
      having to do it in a different order. So, with some classmates
      he decided to develop a GPS guide <i> home made </i>. When they picked up the map
      João's distribution zone (given in the figure), they soon realized that the
      problem was facilitated by being in Espinho: the streets formed a pattern
      almost square and their names were numbers. Fruit of good organization,
      decided to divide the work by several components. It was up to João
      develop the part that gave the directions knowing the points where it was going
      pass.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00061000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> João leaves every day from the central bakery, point <b> (4,5) </b>, and
    his van is always facing <b> East </b> (on the map, to the right).
    For the sequence of journeys that he has to take that day, the GPS <i> home
    made </i> goes on giving the directions to follow, saying if it will move on
    (<b> F </b>) or if you have to turn left (<b> E </b>), turn right
    (<b> D </b>), or reverse (<b> I </b>). If it is not necessary to change
    of direction says forward (<b> F </b>). So, when there is an intersection it gives
    always an indication, as well as at the beginning of each route. If you give
    <b> E </b>, <b> D </b> or <b> I </b>, no longer gives <b> F </b>. When arrives
    at the end of a route, that is, to a customer, says stop (<b> S </b>).
    <p>
      Each route starts at the place where João is at the moment and is
      described by a sequence of dots that identify all intersections
      where you must change direction. The last point on a route defines a
      delivery location (customer).

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00062000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> In the first line you have the number of customers you should visit (in the
    maximum 4), which corresponds to the number of journeys to be made. It follows the
    description of the routes, which, for each route, begins with an integer
    which indicates the number of points that define it, and then has the coordinates
    of those points. Each point is given on a line by two integers separated by
    a space.

    identified by the letters <b> F </b>, <b> E </b>, <b> D </b>, <b> I </b>, and
