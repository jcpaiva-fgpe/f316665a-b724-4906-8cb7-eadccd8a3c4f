      A circumference of center <em> C </em> and radius <em> r </em> is the place
      geometry of points on the plane that are <em> r </em> from the point
      <em> C </em>. The circle delimited by this circumference is made up
      by points whose distance <em> C </em> is less than or equal to <em> r </em>. THE
      circumference is the boundary of the circle and the remaining points constitute
      its interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <em> (a, b) </em> and <em> (c, d) </em> are the coordinates of two points
      <em> P </em> and <em> Q </em> in the usual orthonormal Cartesian framework,
      then the square of the distance between <em> P </em> and <em> Q </em> is given by
      <em> (c-a) (c-a) + (d-b) (d-b) </em>.

    </h2> Write a program that given a circumference and a sequence of
    points characterize the position of each point in relation to the bounded circle
    by that circle, indicating whether it is <code> inside </code>,
    <code> at the border </code> or <code> outside </code> of the circle.
    <p>
      The first line of input has the coordinates of the center of the circle
      and the second has the radius measurement. In the next line you have the number of
      points of the sequence and, in the others, the <em> x </em> and
      <em> y </em> of each point. All values ​​are integers in the range
      [-1000,1000] (naturally the radius is positive).
    </p>
    <p>
      The program presents the classification of points, in the order in which they were
      Dice. Each line of output follows the format
      <code>(</code><em>x</em><code>,</code><em>y</em> <code>): </code>
      <em> pos </em>, where <em> pos </em> is the point classification and <em> x </em>
      and <em> y </em> their coordinates.
