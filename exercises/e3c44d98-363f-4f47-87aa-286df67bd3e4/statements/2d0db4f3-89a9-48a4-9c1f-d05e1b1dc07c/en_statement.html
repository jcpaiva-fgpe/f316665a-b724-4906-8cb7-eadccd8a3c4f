      Searching for the Malaysia Airlines plane that disappeared into the ocean
      some oceanographic vessels have detected signals that appear to be
      be emitted by the plane's black box. These signals are very weak,
      they bring a lot of noise and therefore have to be analyzed very carefully. You
      signals come to us in the form of a sequence of numbers, each of which
      representing the measured intensity, ten times per second, over the
      time. Many of these intensities are very low, which means that
      itâ€™s about ocean noise, of no interest, but periodically there are values
      that stand out and may only have originated from a device
      electronic. Here is an example of a section of observations:
    </p>
    <div style = "margin-left: 2em">
      2 2 2 3 4 5 <font color =
      "red"> <b> 15 </b> </font> 4 3 4 5 2
      2 <font color = "red"> <b> 10 </b> </font> 4 2
      2 6 <font color = "red"> <b> 13 </b> </font> 6
      7 3 4 <font color = "red"> <b> 18 </b> </font>
      6
    </div> The numbers marked in red stand out clearly from their
    neighbors and, by chance, come from the plane's black box. At
    search teams need a program to count the signals coming from the
    black box of the plane, following numbers under analysis. We consider that
    a signal was emitted by the black box when its intensity is greater than
    twice the intensity of each of the two neighboring signals, before and after.

    positive count the number of numbers that are simultaneously greater than the
    double the immediately preceding number in the sequence and greater than double
    of the number immediately following in the sequence.
