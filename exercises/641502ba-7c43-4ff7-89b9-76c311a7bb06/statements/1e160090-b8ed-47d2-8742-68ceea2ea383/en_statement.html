      Everyone agrees that the climate is changing. Some think that
      days are hotter, others guarantee that they are the nights that no longer
      are so cold, others that are the thermal amplitudes (the difference
      between consecutive maximum and minimum temperature) that have increased, or
      perhaps the opposite, now the temperatures cannot be distinguished. To take off
      this clean we will make a program that determines all these maximums,
      minimums and variations.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that calculates the maximum, the minimum, the maximum amplitude and
      the minimum amplitude of a sequence of temperature values. At
      temperatures are given by integers in degrees centigrade. THE
      amplitude is the difference between a local maximum and a local minimum
      consecutive. A value is a local maximum if it is greater than or equal to your
      neighbors on both sides. Likewise, a value is a local minimum if
      is less than or equal to its neighbors. Note that the maximum or
      minimum can be maintained throughout consecutive readings, as it happens
      in the example with the minimum location where the maximum amplitude is reached. We can
      assume that the initial and final values ​​of the given series are always a
      local minimum or maximum. We also assume that there are no three records
      consecutive consecutive periods.
