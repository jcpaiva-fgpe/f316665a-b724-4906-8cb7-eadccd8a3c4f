      Ana and Carlos, who live in Porto, were excited about the idea
      in July to go to the University of Algarve to attend a summer course
      for secondary school students. So they are already doing the
      preparations for the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ideal is to go by train, from Porto to Faro. The normal price of the trip,
      in tourist class, it is € 51.50. Fortunately, as both are young people with
      under the age of 26, are automatically entitled to a 25% discount. Now
      25% of 51.50 is 12.87.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the exact amount would be slightly higher, but the CP makes the
      discount accounts up to cents. Soon, the price of the trip would be
      € 38.63. Only that the CP, to facilitate change (they say ...) rounds
      all prices up, up to the immediate 50 cent multiple. Or
      that is, the trip costs 39 euros each.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wouldn't be bad anymore, but Ana and Carlos discovered that if they buy the
      ticket five days in advance or more will have a discount
      additional 40%. That is, as 40% of 39 is 15.6, the price with the
      40% discount and such rounding to the multiples of 50 cents is
      at € 23.50. In fact, if the purchase is eight days or more in advance, the
      discount goes up to 65%, which is even more advantageous.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the possible discounts don't stop there, Ana and
      Carlos: if you can bring at least two other friends with you,
      become a group and are entitled to a discount
      additional 50%. I mean, if all four (or more) had
      decided to buy the ticket at the same time, with five days of
      advance, the discount on 23.50 would be 11.75, so, having made the
      accounts, and considering the ill-fated rounding, the trip for each
      one of the group members would stay for € 12.00. Of course if you buy with
      eight days or more in advance, the price will be even lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      This discount scheme applies to all long-haul trips. Per
      so, if Ana and Carlos end up deciding to go to summer school
      to another site, for example, the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, will have to make
      similar accounts, starting with the price of the Porto-Lisbon trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, instead of doing the math by hand, it is best to write a
      program that takes care of that.

      group size (all young), determine the price of each ticket,
