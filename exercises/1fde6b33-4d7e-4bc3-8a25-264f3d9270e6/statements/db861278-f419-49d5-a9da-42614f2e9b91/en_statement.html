      People with overloaded schedules have some difficulty in scheduling
      meetings. There are those that say "I can from <em> x </em> to <em> y </em>, but to
      <em> y </em> I already have another meeting "and the ones that say" I can't
      <em> z </em> at <em> t </em>, but at <em> t </em> I'm already free ". The others
      possibilities are not going to be interesting right now and for simplicity's sake let's
      suppose they always say "I can".
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00021000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> Write a program that, given the expected duration (in hours) for a
    meeting between two people and two pairs of integers <em> A B </em> and <em> C
    D </em>, check if it is possible to schedule the meeting and when. In this case, the
    first person would say "I can from <em> A </em> hours to <em> B </em> hours, but
    at <em> B </em> I already have another meeting "and the second would say" I can
    <em> C </em> hours at <em> D </em> hours, but at <em> D </em> I already have another
    meeting ", with <em> A, B, C </em> and <em> D </em> integers between 9 and 19.
    <em> A </em> is assumed to be less than <em> B </em> and <em> C </em> is less
    than <em> D </em>.
    <p>
      The meeting must take place between 9 and 19 hours and its duration is a
      whole. The first line of data has this duration and the next two
      the two pairs mentioned. Depending on the case, the program writes a line or
      with the word <code> Impossible </code> (without accent) or with an integer if the
      meeting only if it can be held in an hour or with two integers if there is
      flexibility (these integers define the interval in which you can fix the
      beginning of the meeting).
