    </div> A <em> slot-machine </em> often retains change or part of it,
    leaving users unhappy. This is because the machine can only
    accepts coins of certain values ​​(from 2 euros, 1 euro, and 50, 20, 10 and 5
    cents) and sometimes, after a few transactions, certain currencies become
    temporarily depleted. It also happens because, to make a
    amount, the machine always starts by using the highest value coins that
    have. This way of operating is not very correct. For example, if in a certain
    instant, the machine only has 50 and 20 cent coins, not
    would be able to return 60 cents (would retain 10 cents). Users
    unprepared, who insert much larger amounts than necessary, can
    be baffled.

    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Task </font>
    </h2> Write a program that simulates the behavior of the machine when it is
    A sequence of transactions is carried out from a given state. O
    program should determine the amount the machine has retained and the fraction of
    transactions with change retention.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Input </font>
    </h2> In the first line you have the number of coins of each type available
    initially, in the order given above. The following is a description of a
    sequence of transactions to process, ending with <b> 0 0 </b>. There will be at
    least one transaction. The first line of each transaction consists of
    a pair <b> (E, D) </b> of non-negative integers that represent the amount to
    pay (<b> E </b> euros and <b> C </b> cents), followed by the sequence of
    currencies introduced by the customer (ending with <b> 0 </b>).
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Output </font>
    </h2> You will write the total amount retained and on the next line the fraction of
    transactions with retention, ending with a change of line. That fraction
    will have the form <b> N / T </b>, where <b> N </b> can be zero (<b> T </b> designates the
    total number of transactions).
