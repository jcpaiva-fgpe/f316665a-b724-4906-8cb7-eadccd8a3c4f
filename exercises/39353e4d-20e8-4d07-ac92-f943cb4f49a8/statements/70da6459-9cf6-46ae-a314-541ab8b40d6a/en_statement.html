      Machine translation is sometimes useful, but it doesn't always work well. It was the
      that happened when we wanted to translate the lyrics of a children's song that
      starts with "<em> If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands </em>" by
      English to Portuguese and vice versa. The proposed translation - "<em> if you
      is happy and you know it, clap your hands </em> "- it didn't sound like much
      well, nor others.

      <a name="SECTION00011000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2> It is intended to correct a text, replacing "<code> applauds your
    hands </code> "and" <code> it has beaten palms </code> "by" <code> beat
    clapping </code> "and" <code> clap your hands </code> ", respectively. The text
    has only two lines and each corresponds exactly to one of the four
    following sentences (written without accents):
    <pre>
clap your hands
it has beaten palms
clap your hands
clap your hands
</pre> The program writes the corrected sentences, not changing "<code> hit
clapping </code> "and" <code> clap your hands </code> ".
