    </h2>
    <p>
      In the kingdom of Lusitania, the Automobile and Highway Center (CAR)
      recently presented a new plan for the allocation of enrollments
      automobiles. This plan, in addition to proposing a new attribution model,
      presents an elaborate statistical study about the past years. At
      elaboration of this study, one of the most relevant tasks was to calculate the
      number of vehicles registered during the last few years.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00032000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that, given the enrollment of the first and last
      vehicle registered in a given year, calculate the number of vehicles
      enrolled in that same year. Consider only enrollments of the type
      AA-AA-LL, where A is a number and L is one of the 23 letters of the alphabet
      Portuguese. The first registration is 00-00-AA and the last is 99-99-ZZ. THE
      enrollment assignment follows the following criteria: (i) starting from the
      last assigned number, the second number of digits is incremented by
      one unit; (ii) if the second pair of digits reaches the value 99, this
      becomes 00 and the first pair of digits is incremented by one;
      (iii) if the first pair of digits reaches the value 99, it changes to 00
      and the second letter is incremented by one, according to the order of
      letters in the alphabet; (iv) if the second letter reaches the value Z, it passes
      a A and the first letter are incremented by one.

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00033000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first line of input is an integer N (<img width = "62" height = "31"
      align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img5.gif" alt = "$ <= 100 $">) which indicates the
      number of enrollment pairs to consider. The next N lines are
      number plates of type AA-AA-LL, where A is a digit and L is a
      of the 23 letters of the Portuguese alphabet. The first registration of each pair says
      respect to the first motor vehicle registered in a given year, while
      the second concerns the last vehicle registered that same year.

    <p>
      The output is a set of N lines, where each line has the number
      number of vehicles registered based on the indicated registration number.
