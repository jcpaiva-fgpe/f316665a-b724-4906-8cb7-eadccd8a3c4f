      When Rui was studying Chemistry, writing formulas of compounds
      in the notebook (like CaCO <sub> 3 </sub>, Na <sub> 2 </sub> CO <sub> 3 </sub> and
      H <sub> 2 </sub> SO <sub> 4 </sub>), appeared the younger sister, who stayed
      fascinated with those sequences of letters and figures. The worst is that she
      he was not silent, demanding that he explain to him how he divided a sequence
      big in little pieces. Desperate, Rui enunciated the rules:
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Each sequence of letters that begins with a large letter (the sister
      knew the word "capital") represents an element;
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <ul>
      <li> If there is a number after the element, this is the number of
      atoms of the element; if not, the number of atoms in the element is 1.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Then, he exemplified with the calcium carbonate formula,
      CaCO <sub> 3 </sub>, which has a calcium atom (Ca), a carbon atom
      (C) and three oxygen atoms (O).
    </p>
    <p>
      The sister was very happy and wanted to learn more chemistry. But he
      convinced her to practice. In order to be able to return to the study quickly,
      decided to write "chemical formulas" for nothing and even invented symbols
      chemicals with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 letters. For example, it gave you the formula
      Ai <sub> 19 </sub> Xpto <sub> 5 </sub> Uus (which has size 12) for
      decompose.

      A line with a chemical formula (invented by Rui) terminated by
      "<tt>. </tt>". The formula is a sequence of \ (n \) letters and numbers,
      that starts with a capital letter and does not have a zero
      immediately after a letter, not even a lower case immediately
      after a number. No element has more than five letters, nor
      occurs more than once in the formula. The number of digits followed
      does not exceed \ (n-1 \).

      The output has one line for each element that occurs in the formula. Each
      line has an element, a space, the number of atoms of that element and a
      line change. Elements must appear in the order in which they occur
      in the formula.
