      Problem
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yesterday, May 12th, he was found in the wonderful garden of the future
      building of the Department of Computer Science, a UFO with a life
      extra-terrestrial (ET) on board. The ET was removed from the ship without any
      physical injury, but in apparent shock. Called to the site, the
      INEM was unable to do anything to assess his condition, transporting him
      immediately to the nearest hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognized Portuguese scientists then worked together to
      try to assess his health status. The discoveries were
      impressive. According to the clinical bulletin, released after several hours,
      they had managed to completely unravel the genetic code of ET. Your
      DNA was only made up of 3 distinct elements: <tt> c </tt>,
      <tt> t </tt> and <tt> a </tt> (the human genome consists of 4 elements).
      Scientists also realized that the DNA of ET was mutated by
      every hour that passed, following a constant pattern. The first element
      of the DNA was maintained but the remaining elements of the DNA were altered
      according to the following rule. For each pair of neighboring letters, the second
      it was changed if it was different from the previous one. In this case, it was replaced
      by the letter that was not in the pair. For example, for the DNA sequence
      <tt> actt </tt>, the mutation would be:
    </p>
    <div align = "center">
      <table cellpadding = "3">
        <tr>
          <td align = "left">
            the first letter remains <tt> a </tt>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align = "left">
            the second letter of the pair <tt> ac </tt> evolves into <tt> t </tt>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align = "left">
            the second letter of the pair <tt> ct </tt> evolves into <tt> a </tt>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td align = "left">
            the second letter of the pair <tt> tt </tt> remains <tt> t </tt>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div> and the end result would be <tt> atat </tt>. Changes in a sequence
    occurred simultaneously.

    <h2>
      Assignment
    </h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that, given an ET DNA status, calculates what will be
      your state after an hour.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Input
    </h2>
    <p>
      The input is a sequence of letters (<tt> c </tt>, <tt> t </tt> or <tt> a </tt>
      separated by spaces), arbitrarily long, representing the DNA of the ET,
      and ending with <tt> # </tt>. In the data, there is one symbol per line.
      All lines have a newline character.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      Output
    </h2>
    <p>
      The output is the DNA sequence after a mutation. It will end by
      line change.
    </p>
