      <a name="SECTION00001000000000000000"> Problem </a>
    </h2> The Maracanã Stadium, located in the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro, was
    opened on 16 June 1950 and currently has a capacity for 200
    000 people, which is reduced to 100 000 for security reasons.
    Assuming that the posts are numbered from 1 to 200 000, and that
    ticket reservations for places with these numbers, it is intended to verify
    whether a sequence of ticket reservations is <em> acceptable </em>. To this end, the
    total number of tickets sold should not exceed 100 000 and cannot be
    two (or more) tickets with the same number may be sold.
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00002000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that checks whether a sequence of reservations is
      <em> acceptable </em> and, if so, indicate the places sold, in a
      Synthesized. Reservations can be made for individual tickets or for
      multiple tickets with consecutive numbers.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00003000000000000000"> Input </a>
    </h2> The sequence of reservations is given, one reservation on each line. The sequence
    ends with <img width = "28" height = "31" align = "middle" border = "0" src =
    "img1.gif" alt = "$ \ mathbf {{-} 1} $"> and always have at least one reservation and at
    maximum 100. Each reservation can be of the form <img width = "30" height = "15"
    align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img2.gif" alt = "$ \ mathbf {0} \; n $"> or
    <img width = "50" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img3.gif" alt =
    "$ \ mathbf {1} \; n \; m $">. In the first case, it is just a ticket, which
    must have the number <img width = "15" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0"
    src = "img4.gif" alt = "$ n $">. In the second, it's <img width = "81" height = "31"
    align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img5.gif" alt = "$ m-n + 1 $"> tickets whose
    numbers are those in the range <img width = "48" height = "35" align = "middle"
    border = "0" src = "img6.gif" alt = "$ {\ mathbf [n, m]} $">, that is, <img width = "15"
    height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src = "img4.gif" alt = "$ n $">,
    <img width = "45" height = "31" align = "middle" border = "0" src = "img7.gif" alt =
    "$ n + 1 $">, ..., <img width = "20" height = "15" align = "bottom" border = "0" src =
    "img8.gif" alt = "$ m $">. For example,
    <pre>
0 13
1 500 1000
1 57 499
...
</pre> would indicate, the reservation of number 13, of all numbers from 500 to 1000, of
all from 57 to 499, ...
    <p> </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00004000000000000000"> Output </a>
    </h2> You must indicate the total number of tickets booked, and on the lines
    following a representation of the set of reservations made.
    <p>
      The set must be ordered, and it will be the union of the sets that
      indicate on each line, and its representation must be the most compact
      possible. Whenever you have booked tickets with consecutive numbers,
      you should include them all in one interval. Isolated ticket reservations,
      should be grouped, as long as the final set is kept in order
      (as shown below).
    </p>
    <p>
      The total number of tickets booked will be <code> 0 </code> if not
      possible to make the sequence of reservations, as this is not
      <em> acceptable </em>. In that case, you will not write anything on the next line.
