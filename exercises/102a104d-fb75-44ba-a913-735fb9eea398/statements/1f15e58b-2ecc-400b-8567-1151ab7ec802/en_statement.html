      It is Saint Anthony's day in the realm of expression, and parentheses and
      braces are thrilled to be getting married. However, they still need
      find your match. The bride and groom will await their brides in order and,
      so as not to create too much confusion, they will leave as soon as they arrive. Like
      are modern people, they will even resort to a computer program to
      control this process.

    </h2>
    <p>
      The program must read a line of text with an expression, which can contain
      curved brackets, straight brackets and braces. If all pairs
      are well matched, the program should print the type of each pair -
      <b> () </b>, <b> [] </b> or <b> {} </b> - and their respective
      opening and closing positions (starting at 0). A printout must be printed
      line for each pair, in the closing order (the second number is strictly
      growing). If any of the couples are ill-married, the program should only
      print a line saying <b> Malformed pairs </b>. If the line does not
      does not contain parentheses or braces, the program must print a line
      say <b> No boyfriends to marry </b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no need to do any validation of the expression other than marriage
      brackets and braces. The expression has no more than 1000 symbols. At
      output, the integers are separated from the pair type by a space, but the
      parentheses or braces have no separators between them.
