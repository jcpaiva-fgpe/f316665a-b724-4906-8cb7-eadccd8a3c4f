      Letter soup is a kind of puzzle often used as an exercise,
      to improve students' vocabulary in a certain field. This puzzle
      consists of a matrix of letters where words are formed, which can be
      occur in the same row, column or diagonal. To make the challenge more
      interesting words may even be written backwards.
      Sometimes itâ€™s so hard to find all the words!

    <h2>
      <a name="SECTION00031000000000000000"> Task </a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that reads an array of letters and a set of
      words and writes the location of the first last letter of each word
      read. The letters of the words are in contiguous positions on the same line,
      column or diagonal, and may be in reverse order. It can be assumed that
      each word occurs only once, no word is a sub-word of
      another, although the same positions of the matrix can be used in several
      words. The matrix cells are referenced by their row and column,
      row 1 being the first to count from the top and column number 1 being
      further to the left.
