      Like the signs of the Zodiac, there are twelve Chinese signs. However,
      Chinese apply for a period of about a year and not about a year.
      month, as is the case with the Zodiac. Chinese signs are therefore
      order, <b> rat </b>, <b> ox </b>, <b> tiger </b>, <b> rabbit </b>,
      <b> dragon </b>, <b> snake </b>, <b> horse </b>, <b> sheep </b>,
      <b> monkey </b>, <b> rooster </b>, <b> dog </b>, and <b> pig </b> (intentionally
      without accents).

      Chinese signs change in the Chinese lunar new year that does not coincide with the
      solar new year on the julian calendar so we rule in the west,
      but the difference is not big. For example, this year, when we
      we celebrated St. Valentine's Day - Valentine's Day - on the 14th of
      February, the Chinese welcomed the year of the tiger. Thus
      we can say with a slight error that the year 2010 is the year of the tiger.

    </h2> Given a year in the Julian calendar, we intend to obtain the Chinese sign
    corresponding, without accents. The years can vary between 5000 B.C. and 5000
    D.C., the years of the common era being represented by positive integers and the
    years prior to the common era represented as negative numbers. It's from
    note that the Romans were unaware of the zero and as such there was never a
    year zero (which later gave rise to immense misunderstandings about whether the
    2000 would be the beginning of the 21st century).
