<P>
Per
pure fun or some kind of disturbance, it is usual for dogs and
cats whirl frantically while trying to catch their own tail
(<EM> `` be chasing my tail '' </EM>
it means to be busy with a thousand and one tasks, but little success).
With so many turns, you can imagine that after a while
dizzy, that sometimes rotate to one side now
rotate to each other, etc. We want to know what the position, the direction of
movement and the state of an animal
after having made a sequence of movements,
whereas:

<UL>
<LI> initially, the animal is fine (<code> normal </code> state) and has the
head to the south (<code> S </code>);
</LI>
<LI> each movement corresponds to a rotation of a
multiple of <IMG
 WIDTH = "29" HEIGHT = "15" ALIGN = "BOTTOM" BORDER = "0"
 SRC = "img11.gif"
 ALT = "$ 45 ^ \ circ $">; can be done clockwise (<code> CW </code>) or
counterclockwise (<code> CCW </code>); the first move will be
counterclockwise;
</LI>
<LI> if the amplitude of a given movement exceeds <IMG
 WIDTH = "38" HEIGHT = "15" ALIGN = "BOTTOM" BORDER = "0"
 SRC = "img12.gif"
 ALT = "$ 720 ^ \ circ $"> (two laps),
the animal is <code> dizzy </code> and starts to rotate in the opposite direction;
will return to
<code> normal </code> state as soon as it rotates again (if this movement does not
rotate too much again).
</LI>
</UL>

<H2> <A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">
Task </A>
</H2>
Write a program that, given a sequence of movements, indicates the
final position of the animal's head (<code> N </code>,
<code> S </code>, <code> E </code>, <code> W </code>, <code> NE </code>, <code> SE </code>, <code> NW < / code>, or
<code> SW </code>), the direction in which the animal would rotate
(<code> CW </code> or <code> CCW </code>), and its final state (<code> normal </code> or
<code> silly </code>). Each line of <EM> input </EM> has a positive integer
multiple of 45 (and less than 2000), which
represents the amplitude of the rotation, with the exception of the last line
has <code> -1 </code>. There will be at least one movement. The program writes a suit
<code> (position, direction, state) </code>, with a space after each comma,
followed by line change.
