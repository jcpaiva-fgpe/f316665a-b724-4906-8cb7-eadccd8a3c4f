    "right"> Searching the attic we find a true relic: one of the
    first digital thermometers of the last century that, in addition to the temperature
    current, it also displays the maximum and minimum temperatures of the last 24
    hours. Unfortunately the thermometer is out of order and there does not seem to be a
    way to calibrate it. <br>
    <br>
    However, as we know the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded on the day
    above, and we can easily know what the maximum and maximum temperatures were
    minimum effective consultations with a newspaper, we can apply a linear function
    to correct the thermometer values. That is, to correct the values
    we can use a function whose graph is a line. <br>
    <br>
    The correction function will transform the minimum temperature of the thermometer into
    actual minimum temperature and the maximum temperature of the thermometer at the temperature
    actual maximum. We can assume that the minimum and maximum temperatures recorded
    by the thermometer they are never of equal value. <br>
    <h2>
      <font color = "blue"> Task </font>
    </h2> Your task is to make a program that starts by reading the temperatures
    minimum and maximum temperatures recorded by the thermometer, then the minimum and
    maximum temperatures, followed by a sequence of temperatures terminated by
    a value equal to or greater than 100.0. For each of these temperatures
    (except the four initials used to calibrate and the one that ends the
    sequence) the program writes the temperature value applying the correction
    linear. The values ​​for all temperatures are floating point, and the
    values ​​must be rounded to one decimal place. <br>
