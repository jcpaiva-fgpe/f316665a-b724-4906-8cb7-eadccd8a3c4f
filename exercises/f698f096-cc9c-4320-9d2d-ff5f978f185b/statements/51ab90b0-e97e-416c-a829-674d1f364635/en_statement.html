      A walker likes to record the distance covered in each of the
      your walks. And, in order to control its evolution, you want to know the
      difference between the distances covered in consecutive walks.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that, for each recorded walk (except the
      first), indicates if the distance covered in this walk has increased
      (<tt> HIGH </tt>), remained (<tt> PATAMAR </tt>) or decreased
      (<tt> LOW </tt>) in relation to the distance covered in the previous walk.
      When the distance has increased or decreased, the program calculates the difference
      between the distances covered, in kilometers and meters.

      The input has \ (n + 1 \) lines.

    <p>
      Each of the \ (n \) first lines has a record of a walk. THE
      line has two integers, \ (k \) and \ (m \), which indicate that the
      hiker covered \ (k \) kilometers and \ (m \) meters.

      The last line, which no longer corresponds to a walk, has <tt> 0 0 </tt>.
