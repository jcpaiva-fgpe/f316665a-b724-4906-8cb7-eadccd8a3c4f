    </h2> In a competition with 10 players (numbered from 0 to 9), the competitor wins
    with the most consecutive correct answers. Approves
    unfolds as follows: a competitor is selected
    randomly to respond. Whenever it gives a right answer the
    competitor wins a point and retains the right to reply. Whenever
    a wrong answer the competitor loses the right to answer being
    randomly selected another competitor. The information of a test
    consists of a sequence of digits corresponding to the numbers of the
    players who responded correctly to the answers. For example in the test
    <pre>
0 0 2 3 5 5 4 4 4 7 5 5 5 5 1 9
</pre> The winner was competitor 5 with a maximum of 4 right answers
consecutive.
    <p>
      In the event of a tie, the first player to obtain the maximum
      right answers. For example in the test
    </p>
    <pre>
0 2 3 4 4 4 7 5 5 1 1 1 9 4 4 5 5 5
</pre> The winner was competitor 4 because he was the first to get 3 answers
consecutive certain. <br>

    </h2> Write a program that, given a sequence of digits (0, 1, ...,
    9), containing the information of a race, determine which winner of the race
    and the number of responses that gave him the victory. That is, determine what the
    size of the largest sub-sequence of consecutive occurrences of the same digit
    (number of responses) and for which digit did this maximum occur (number of
    player).
